<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First up is: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-829">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-829</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I'm happy to look into this one a bit -- I have a bunch of other OAI issues that I want to look at anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes it looks like PeterDietz's kompewter "bot" is offline today, so we'll have to paste in full links</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; though I agree with Robin's comments</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks aschweer.  I think Ds-829 just needs some more eyes on it.  It'd be good to get them an answer around whether it seems like a logical feature for 1.8 (or if major changes would be necessary)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks also PeterDieta for bringing back kompewter ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz that is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; tdonohue: You're welcome.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; yep, I'm back in the office nowadays</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; welcome back</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, Ds-829 summary: aschweer is going to also review this one.  Hopefully between her and robint we can start to determine the plausibility of inclusion for 1.8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Next up, DS-830</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue should note...there's about 3-4 in a row here which are *larger* new features which were submitted by U of Minho &amp; others.  So, many of these essentially need someone to review the work and comment on it, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; isn't Ds-830 very similar, functionality-wise, to an issue we reviewed last week?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; (sorry, pre morning coffee, hence a bit vague on details)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; looks like we should link Ds-830 to Ds-824 (latter is already assigned to scottatm)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Hi all. Apologies for being late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; likewise</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; Has anyone reviewed/looked at this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; no prob, we're just doing a JIRA review (as normal)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; richardrodgers: not to my knowledge.  Ds-831 needs a review</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Hi aschweer: I'll email you some thoughts I have about DS829. Cheers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; thanks robint</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; wait, isn't a version of Ds-830 already in DSpace?  We call it "Recent Submissions" (it's at least in the XMLUI in 1.7.x)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yes, one of my repos is running it. not sure there is anything for jspui though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; (assuming you mean Ds-831)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, sorry, Ds-831 is what I meant :) mistyped</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; Recent Submissions have been in DSpace since the ice age</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; this feature gives recent submissions to the homepage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, so, I guess in the end, we still just need a volunteer to review Ds-831 and report back</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any volunteers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, Ds-831 Summary: Needs a volunteer to review &amp; report back.  If anyone has time, we'd appreciate others opinions on this feature.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Let's go ahead and do one more (as this is the last of the group of Minho patches in JIRA): DS-832</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-832">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-832</a> ] - [#DS-832] Stats Add-on - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, this is the Minho Statistics Engine.  What are others opinions on this? Do we give them a place in our SVN for this code?  Do we make it another option for a Stats engine in DSpace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; what are the experiences with previous versions of their stats add-on? is it typically stable enough that others can pretty much run it out of the box?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I think the svn issue is not as important as how projects like this get distributed/managed...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Historically there were some issues but it has improved a lot over the years</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The only comment I have minho stats was that it took work to "americanize" the dates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I do recall that this (Minho stats) was one of the more popular Statistics Engines until the Solr-based Stats were created.  I know some folks still use Minho Stats, but I don't have any experience with it myself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-green">* bojans (~bojan@62.68.103.78) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; from a quick glance at the zip file, it seems to make changes to the db schema, so I guess the comment by richardrodgers is very true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, it does change the DB schema.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Yep it uses a seperate postgres namespace for their tables (not sure if namespace is the right term)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, what do we think about these sorts of projects?  Do we just let them "sit idle in JIRA"?  Do we offer up SVN space (but not necessarily support the code ourselves)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (also, we can set this aside &amp; "table it" if we feel this is a much larger discussion -- e.g. semi-related perhaps to modules &amp; async releases &amp; similar)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; feels to me like it belongs to that larger discussion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; me too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; a larger discussion as well for the way to accomplish add-on database tables...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; It might be worth an email to the Minho guys just to say that their various contributions are actively being looked at</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Ds-832 Summary:  We need to determine how best to distribute/manage these sorts of projects in the future.  This should be part of the larger 'async &amp; modules' discussions, as it provides a good example of a third-party module, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: sure, though currently we only have volunteers for Ds-829 and Ds-830.     Ds-831 didn't get a volunteer, and Ds-832 was tabled for the async discussion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: understood, but I think thats better than nothing. I'll email if thats ok with everyone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: sounds good.  I'll also post a comment specifically to Ds-832 to describe why this is "tabled", and how it may relate to future async discussions (so that they understand some of what is being discussed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we'll stop JIRA review there for today.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The rest of the meeting is actually basically "open discussion" today (I couldn't think of any specific topics to fit in, and none were suggested).  Do we want to just talk about 1.8 updates or anything anyone needs support/feedback on?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (essentially, the "floor is open" for someone to suggest a topic)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Ofc the implemention for vivisimo isn't shared since it isn't usefull but I think the feature that anybody can plug any backend into it might be very usefull</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; during meeting on June 22 we had discussed targeting a few Committers who are working heavily with Discovery to have them review DSCR-22 (stuartlewis &amp; kshepherd were mentioned)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV did you still mainly need volunteer(s) to review this work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; Can it be reviewed without the alternate back-end?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd looks up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well Mark Diggory has reviewed and likes it (don't know why he hasn't said so in the JIRA but prob to busy...)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Alternatively, is there anyone here who is using Discovery heavily already, and would be interested in looking at this patch/change?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; It can be reviewed without the alternate back end. The solr backend is still used by default</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it's usually "best practice" to have a few committers take a look at it if it's a larger change like this sounds</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I already sent an additional mail for that to KimShepard &amp; Stuart lewis &amp; DSpace devel to get additional reviews</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think its good to generalize the things that were so tightly integrated with Solr. So this is good work. I was trying to connect dspace-stats to use something other than solr, and would first have to generalize the implementation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so.. this is essentially the work needed to be done.. to discovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hm, i don't recall getting anything, maybe i missed it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: have you already taken a look at this DSCR-22  patch then?  Or would you be willing to review &amp; add your thoughts in comments?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Anybody is free to review it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think essentially, we just need more "eyes" on DSCR-22.  I'd be fine with it if we can get a few folks to add their +1 to it.  It sounds like mdiggory is already in favor</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; The reason why I bring this up now is because I would like to so it committed in the near future because I'm on vacation and might find some time to improve the configuration of discovery</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; So the intent is to have it in 1.8?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; In principle I'm in favour but I'm ignorant abut the implementation of Discovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; based on discussion on June 22, mdiggory really wanted this change in 1.8.0  (but, I know mdiggory is on vacation this week, which is why he isn't here to add his thoughts)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; T.b.h. I kind of have some more work planned for 1.8, but again I'm doing this in my free time so I don't know how far I'm going to get</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; same as robint</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, sounds like we have no one wanting to volunteer here, KevinVdV.  I can always respond to your initial email, and see if we can find someone who is using Discovery / Solr more heavily to review the work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i can review, but i'm so "solr" centric myself that i don't have any other backends to test, nor the desire to move to anything that isn't solr ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; maybe i could test out elasticsearch one day, but since that means writing hte discovery impl for it, i don't think that'll be any time soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: well, it also could be worth having your opinion on it, in case it changes how we are using solr underneath/etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll also see if I can find some time to do a brief review (though admittedly, I've not really used Discovery much myself)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other thoughts or updates for today?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It's worth mentioning that the 1.8 FEATURE FREEZE is in just a little over a month (Aug 19).  So, I hope everyone is getting their new features ready to go, etc</span><br />
