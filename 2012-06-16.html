<span class="irc-date">[6:12]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-mrmist- Our services upgrade and database prune is scheduled to start at 2pm GMT, which is just slightly less than 7 hours away.  There will be no chanserv or nickserv for around an hour. Consider opping up on your channels in advance of the outage. More messages to follow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:19]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-mrmist- The observant ones noticed that my last message contained an error, it's 8 hours away from how.
