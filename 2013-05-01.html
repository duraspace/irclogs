<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well, i think my opinion i sclear from the comments, i would only like to add that Kevin assigned my suggestion (DS-1188) to himself, so I hope we can solve this more elegantly. I can prod him next time I see him.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; when discovery is disabled we have: recent.submissions.sort-option = dateaccessioned</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm a bit confused on what we are suggesting with regards to Pull #94 / Ds-1278.  Are we just saying it's going to be resolved by Ds-1188 (and going to ask KevinVdV about that)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; Andrea, would you be interested in looking into solving Ds-1188 for JPSUI?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: yes, that's what I'm suggesting. I don't really mind Ds-1278 as an interim/partial solution, I just think we have a bigger problem here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: yes I can look to DS-1188 for 4.0</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: I'd love you for that, I think it's the biggeswt bug DSpace has</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. I've marked Ds-1188 for 4.0.  changed Ds-1278 to be "addressed by" Ds-1188</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; not sure that ds-1188 solve ds-1278 ... recent submissions are shown also in the IR home page</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: good point. but we still need the "by date issued" view first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; s/date issued/date accessioned/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; helix84 meant to say: bollini: good point. but we still need the "by date accessioned" view first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; date issue is different than date accessioned</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok.  sounds like a good idea.  I'm gonna paste this transcript into Ds-1278 shortly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Let's go ahead and do one more PR for today.  #103: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/103">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/103</a> (and DS-1336)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, it *sounds like* this just needs more eyes on it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well, 3 people tested and approved it, including Andrea Schweer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'd merge it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  Yea, it sounds like it has approval to me then too.  You have two committers &amp; another dev.  So, I'd say merge it.  The only question is whether it is good for 3.2 or should wait for 4.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it's a new feature</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 4.0 then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, just realizing it adds a new config to dspace.cfg.  So, it should be 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I switched the ticket to be marked for 4.0 and assigned to helix84.  Feel free to merge &amp; close, helix84 when you get a chance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ok, i'll squash and merge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the last comment there is not so much related to this issue, but raises a good point: "how can I get the locale variable of language session in XMLUI which store the selected interface language like "sessionLocale" variable in JSPUI ?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the answer is it's not possible ATM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; that idea/concept should be moved into it's own ticket, if there's a good use case, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, there is - if you need to have anything in your XSLT displayed differently depending on the currently selected language (text, images, ...)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. feel free to open a new ticket around it then, and hopefully we can figure out a way to make it happen.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'll file a new ticket</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok.  Next on our agenda are our favorite two ongoing topics.  3.2 and 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First, regarding 3.2  : I'll note we've recently moved several tickets from 3.2 to 4.0.  Not sure how much we have that warrants a 3.2, except possibly DS-1528 (which has been a thorn in my side)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1528">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1528</a> ] - [#DS-1528] build.properties doesn&amp;#39;t support UTF-8 encoding - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If anyone has thoughts/ideas or wants to help with Ds-1528, I could use the help.  I've tried pretty much everything I can think of (with no success).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; if we decide we want a 3.2, I can pull the lever</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The bigger question is also whether we want to do a 3.2 in general.  We've had few fixes committed since 3.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; here's the commits since 3.1 (courtesy of GitHub): <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/compare/dspace-3.1...dspace-3_x">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/compare/dspace-3.1...dspace-3_x</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Comparing dspace-3.1...dspace-3_x · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/compare/dspace-3.1...dspace-3_x">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/compare/dspace-3.1...dspace-3_x</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: if there is nothing critical then I would be inclined not to bother with a 3.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we do have bugs to warrant 3.2, we just don't have the fixes :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so far, there is nothing critical that warrants a 3.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (If we could fix Ds-1528, it might be worth a "3.2"...it's arguable.  But, currently we don't have anything really committed on the 3.x branch since 3.1)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, to me, it sounds like 3.2 may be "on hold".  If we find something warranting a 3.2, we could still do one.  But, so far, we've got nothing significant.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I agree with tdonohue's assessment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, hearing no arguments, it sounds like 3.2 is "on hold" for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; On to 4.0 planning then! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd like to formally "pester" each and every one of you to consider joining the 4.0 Release Team. :)   So far, only hpottinger has raised his hand.  I'm obviously willing to chip in... Anyone else interested in joining the team?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger folds his arms and stares at you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I should talk that over with my supervisor.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Sorry but I will have to rule myself out this year</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; definitely talk it over with your supervisor(s), if you may be interested but need approval.   The release timelines are still totally TBD, so we can work it around schedules as needed.  We've only given general dates of late this year (e.g. Oct/Nov/Dec).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I didn't have anything else formal to discuss with regards to 4.0.  But, I did want to touch base and see if anyone is working on something we all should "be aware of" or "be prepared for"?   The only project I'm sorta aware of is an informal group starting to form around getting a REST API finally in 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: Are you following the Fedora 4.0 work at all ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (but, if those who are working towards a REST API want to say more...feel free...I'm not sure I'm fully in the loop there, and it might be good to keep us all in the loop)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I could be available but I need to figure well how this will combine with the dspace-cris project roadmap that we (l_a_p is from the dspace-cris)project are revising in these days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Specifically I am interested in their use of Modeshape</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: very loosely.  I'm aware of some of the Fedora 4 work, but nothing too specific</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: yep, aware they chose Modeshape to build from.  Don't know much more about Modeshape than that.  For those who are unaware, Fedora 4 is essentially a *complete rewrite* of Fedora platform (using ModeShape)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I can't seem to find the time to play with Modeshape but it seems to be an out of the box repository</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; You can build your own app around it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; robint: just let us know when it's time to jump the ship ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Too soon for that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; from my (vague) understandings, having had a chat with eddies (who is lurking here)... Fedora devs were able to rebuild some of the basics of Fedora on ModeShape in a matter of days (IIRC)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84, don't wait for anyone to tell you that kind of thing :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, that's the extent of what I really know :)  Would like to look into ModeShape more at some point myself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (eddies is the Fedora 4 Tech Lead, for those who are unaware...likely most of you know that ... just want to make sure of the fact)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Anyway, sorry for diverting the conversation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in any case, the Fedora 4 work is definitely interesting to keep an eye on.  And it would be good to look closer at ModeShape in general (especially since Fedora folks chose it over many other possibilities, even DYI options, that they reviewed)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; tdonohue meant to say: in any case, the Fedora 4 work is definitely interesting to keep an eye on.  And it would be good to look closer at ModeShape in general (especially since Fedora folks chose it over many other possibilities, even DIY options, that they reviewed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i personally like to hear what's going on with our sibling project</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Modeshape comes with a Rest Api and a Webdav Api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Other 4.0 stuff:  I've been nibbling at the task of hollowing out ConfigurationManager to make it a wrappe around ConfigurationService, so we only have one ultimate source of configuration.  Thoughts?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 single source of configuration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; mhwood: very welcome</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue adds one final note on the Fedora 4 (aka "Fedora Futures") stuff.  If you are interested in learning more about their work, all their resources are now linked off of <a href="http://fcrepo.org/">http://fcrepo.org/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 as well to single source of configs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; re-visiting "discovery by default" that didn't make it into 3.0 - we should get it into 4.0 as early as possible. there already was a PR, we just felt it couldn't get enough testing so late in the cycle.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd be +1 to "Discovery by Default".  We just need someone to push that forward quickly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, if nobody objects to the Config notion, I'll proceed.  I should create a PR on phase I (move news and mail texts elsewhere) but I just shoved that code into new Managers and then thought I might as well make them Services (so e.g. news text source becomes pluggable).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm running into interesting problems of Discovery not working with customized themes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Discovery by default sounds right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood : definitely proceed...and let us know your status and where you could use help, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I can anticipate that we are working on the upgrade to SOLR 4 specifically for statistics improvements</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I can check discovery by default on the jspui as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: if you have any details, feel free to post them to the mailing list. i'll try to look at them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Here's the old "Discovery by Default" JIRA ticket: DS-1272   (I just marked it for 4.0, but we should followup with KevinVdV &amp; mdiggory to see if we can get it in early)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84, the gist of it is: how do I go about getting Discovery content (XSLT, CSS, JS) into my pre-dri2xhtml-alt theme?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: In my experience, don't try to modify dri2xhtml-based theme to dri2xhtml-alt-based one, rewrite it from scratch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; that's what I've decided on, helix84, which means I'm going to have to punt Discovery implementation to my next iteration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: So it is *all* of Discovery that doesn't work with older dri2html themes?  Or just parts of it?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; hpottinger: OTOH, enabling discovert on a dri2xhtml-alt-based theme doesn't bring too many problems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; todonohue: facets work, search works (kind of) but the forms don't display correctly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt;  Heading off, cheers all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; there's quite a bit of JS "magic" that gets lost in translation</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmm.. you might want to mark it as a bug then, hpottinger, if you get a chance.  I wonder if there was something that missed getting "back-ported" to dri2xhtml</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; hpottinger: anyway, i did enable discovery on a Reference-based theme and I think it works fine. I'll give you the URL if you want to try it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84_ thanks, yeah, send me the URL, and if the source is in github, that'd be appreciated, as well :-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; as a note: I also *thought* that Discovery works on out-of-the-box dri2xhtml themes.  But, then again, maybe I'm wrong.   I likely *won't* work on locally customized themes by default though...as Discovery does require some XSLT/CSS/JS updates to themes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, we're at the top of the hour here.  Which means our meeting is "officially" ended.   However, I'm glad to stick around longer if there's any other topics anyone wanted to discuss  (I don't have anything else on the agenda for today)</span><br />
