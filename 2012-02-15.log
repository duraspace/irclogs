<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I know traditional browse has this bug.  Not sure about discovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; maybe they should verify that its just browse by replicating it without discovery enabled.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Discovert shouldn't have this issue, the reason being when an item is deleted from the index there is no way to unindex it in the current browse implementation (correct me if I'm wrong)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; For 1.8.2, I had one ticket specifically that I'd like feedback on, as I'm not clear how the "bitstream reordering" is actually supposed to work: DS-1122</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1122">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1122</a> ] - [#DS-1122] When adding a Bitstream to a Bundle, the &amp;#39;bitstream_order&amp;#39; is always set to the &amp;#39;sequence_id&amp;#39; - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One related issue is that after a new Item Submission, all bitstreams currently start out in a random order (they all are assigned "bitstream_order=-1" by default)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I had also emailed dspace-devel about this, but didn't get any response.  Not sure if anyone here knows how this should function, and whether there is a bug here or not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/dspace-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg08375.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/dspace-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg08375.html</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well it is a bug the numbers of the bitstreams should always be the ones in the order they have been added (for new ones that is)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So you preserve Bitstream order in the AIP?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; nope, I currently cannot preserve bitstream order in the AIPs.  I'd like to preserve it, but currently it's impossible as any new Item added to DSpace (via AIP or via Submission UI) always resets all bitstreams to "order=-1"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; ordering was never a full feature in dspace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm trying to remember my past position on ordering being in Bundle</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. maybe that's my confusion.  I just don't know how this is supposed to work.  The current implementation though makes it impossible to retain ordering in an AIP (In reality, AIPs already retain bitstream ordering, it's just that DSpace cannot restore it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; The bitstream order should be set in the order the bitstreams are added to the item</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Isn't this one of those places where order was thought to be insignificant, and then we heard from the user community that it most definitely is significant?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Order in the UI you mean</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; speaking to mhwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, in the UI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've found the underlying problem here...the underlying issue is that "Bundle.addBitstream()" tries to set the proper order on a new bitstream.  But, unfortunately, it uses "sequence_id" to set the ordering, and "sequence_id" is uninitialized (-1) until Item.update() gets called.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Thus the question is, if ordering is an intrisic part of the DSpace API itself, or just behavior on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Anyway, you get different answers depending on whether you think "how it's supposed to work" means "how was it designed" or "how is it used?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; ordering was a customization after the design.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; but... not to distract...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: sounds like we need a method that includes the ability to pass the order?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; my understanding is that folks really wanted/like this feature (like mhwood remembers).  It also would make sense that if you do a backup &amp; restore (via AIPs or otherwise), you'd expect things to get restored with bitstreams in the same ordering.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory: yea, that might be a possible fix.  I was wanting feedback from others though, as I wasn't sure if I fully understood how this is supposed to work (hence my questions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; If order / position were a property of the Bitstream, then you;d have something concrete to preserve and restore, reguardless of the logic for things getting added to a bundle</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; right now ordering is controlled in Bundle but based on properties of bitstream</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; String bitstreamOrderingField  = ConfigurationManager.getProperty("webui.bitstream.order.field");</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; String bitstreamOrderingDirection   = ConfigurationManager.getProperty("webui.bitstream.order.direction");</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; note these are fields in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; bitstream.*,bundle2bitstream.bitstream_order</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so ordering is derived from either the Bitstream fields or the bundle2bitstream.bitstream_order field</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so this case is only in regards to when its set in bundle2bitstream.bitstream_order</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, mdiggory.  And when you set: 'webui.bitstream.order.field=bistream_order', that's where the ordering is always initialized to -1 for newly added bitstreams</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't see why this is a concern of either Bitstream *or* Bundle.  It seems to me it belongs to Item.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and thats because the sequence isn't producing until a commit happens...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: that's a good thought.  That's exactly how *sequence_id* is managed, at the item level</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; which is what causes the oddity here.  bitstream_order is managed by Bundle, but it tries to initialize itself via the 'sequence_id' which doesn't get initialized until the Item is updated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; that sequence_id comes from?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; bitstream_seq;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; or bundle2bitstream_seq;\</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sequence_id actually doesn't use a DB sequence.  It just locates the highest value in the Item and adds one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; bundle2bitstream_seq;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, this is all a mess, to be honest.  It's just shown itself in the fact that bitstream_order doesn't work as planned</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; mappingRow.setColumn("bitstream_order", b.getSequenceID());</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; comes from the bitstream_seq</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ??</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; just clarifying that I understand now what you said earlier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Couldn't we just add a bitstream_order on bitstream add to bundle &amp; on each remove from bundle recalculate the order of the bitstreams ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- I think so, it's just that in initializing bitstream_order (in add to bundle), you couldn't use 'sequence_id' as it doesn't get initialized until later.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm wondering if it might make more sense to bring this discussion over to dspace-devel or to JIRA ticket?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; True but you could use bitstreams.size() or something like that IF you recalculate it in removeBitstream each time it should be alright</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- yes, that could work. Just not sure how expensive it'd be to recalculate -- but maybe it wouldn't be that bad overall.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well you would just have to recalculate on the bistreams AFTER the current one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; current one == the removed one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, KevinVdV do you want to bring this discussion over to dspace-devel or to Ds-1122?  Maybe we can brainstorm out a resolution/fix along those lines.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I will add this discussion to the JIRA &amp; add my own thoughts below it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; In case it's relevant, there was some discussion of the meaning and use of sequence_id back on 25-Oct-2011:  Message-ID: &lt;20111025175822.GA15444@IUPUI.Edu&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks KevinVdV -- just trying to keep this discussion moving along a bit.  I think your ideas sound good, to be honest &amp; I'd be glad to help test them out once we get them into code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood for tracking that down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  Sorry for taking over this meeting a bit around Ds-1122, but I was just a bit confused as to how to proceed. It'd be nice to fix for 1.8.2 obviously, if we can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anything else folks have that they want to discuss for 1.8.2?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Just a heads up should anybody else have noticed it but I THINK that the solr in DSpace 1.8 will not run on tomcat 5. I plan to investigate this in the weekend &amp; have a fix ready come monday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, thanks for letting us know KevinVdV (hopefully not too many folks are still on Tomcat 5 these days)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like no one else has any 1.8.2 discussions to bring up...so we can move along</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If that's Tomcat 5.0, the fix for this and hundreds of other problems is to upgrade to a maintained version.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I had the issue with tomcat 5.5</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Just wanted to be clear.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; mhwood: ofc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As mentioned via email (and last week's mtg), our first ever Developers Virtual Summit will be Feb 27-Mar 2.  Again, the idea is to make this a sort of "unconference".  But, if folks have topics they'd like to suggest, feel free to post them to the wiki page.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One thing to note on Virtual Summit.  I'm still debating on whether to do this as Google+ or something else (that would allow for more than 10 people at once).  I've already heard some excitement brewing from developers (non-committers) and am not sure if it will make 10 person limit a large issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* bradmc (~bradmc@pool-71-162-98-124.bstnma.east.verizon.net) Quit (Quit: bradmc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, at the same time, I'm hoping to keep these meetings "manageable", so that we can actually get something done.  That gets a bit harder the more people we have in a single meeting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (so -- willing to entertain feedback, either now or later.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; still not even sure what a Hangout is or how one participates in one... guess I'm uncool...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; G+ hangouts can have a spectator-only option, but it's not an option that's available to all Google + users</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Google+ Hangout = Googles version of a "Group Video Chat".  It's almost like a ChatRoom, where folks can hangout and others show up &amp; leave as they want -- but it's video/audio.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; You install the Google Voice and Video Plugin, curse when it crashes your browser, hunt down the backlevel libraries it's linked against, find copies somewhere, and try again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; haha ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think I have it working, sort of, except that it shows a kind of fly's-eye version of me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; ok, I at least knew that, I just don't use it...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm thinking that Skype may be the way to go, if we expect more than 10 participants at a time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. well, the question is -- would you all like to try G+ Hangouts?  The other option is to just do Skype and I can setup a FreeConferenceCallHD phone # that everyone can call into (either via skype or normal phone line)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I actually prefer the IRC channel because of the logging...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Logging +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The problem with IRC is that I find it difficult to discuss topics in much depth at times.  So, I was thinking of this Virtual Summit as more like our normal OR Committers Mtg.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; here's the info I can find on "Hangouts On Air" which does produce a record <a href="http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1669903">http://support.google.com/plus/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=1669903</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Anyone at DuraSpace have any pull with the Google folks?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; no, don't really have any "pull" with Google folks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, is Skype a "good enough" compromise here?   We could always also keep notes via IRC.  THis is actually exactly how Fedora does their weekly meetings -- they meet via Skype, but they keep notes publicly in IRC (one person just writes into IRC the gist of what is going on)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; just trying to get a sense of where folks heads are at (which is also a difficult thing to gage via IRC)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Skype is ok too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think the math is unavoidable: if participant.count &gt; 10 then Skype</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can do Skype if nobody minds that it may not understand my camera yet.  (Test pane just goes black.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I'm sensing here that folks are not sure about G+ hangouts yet.  The 10 person limit also could mean that a few folks would get booted from a particular mtg (if &gt;10 showed up that day)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; if we did Skype it'd be audio only.  I don't have a paid Skype account (which is what you need for Skype Video Chat).  Plus Skype Video has the same 10 person limit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; err, I mean I'd need a paid account to do Skype *Group* Video Chat.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. so, sounds like the consensus is that we may want to just do Skype then, which is fine.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other notes/feedback anyone wants to mention on Virtual Summit?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue realizes we are over time here -- sorry about that.  If you have to head out, feel free.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Final Topic is really just an FYI.  Obviously it's time to start prep for Google Summer of Code.  I've refreshed our "Ideas page" for DSpace. So, it's waiting for potential project ideas!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks KevinVdV, I'll take a look</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; tdonohue I also had a question about the "Virtual summit" wether it is skype or google+ where do we meet ? (or where do you report that you would like to participate that day ?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV: essentially you just "show up" on days that you can.  There's no 'signup' and no formal agenda (it'll be like an unconference -- those in attendance decide what topic(s) to cover that day).  As for "where" we meet....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; since it sounds like we'll meet via Skype, I'll setup a phone# that you can call into (via either Skype or your landline).  It'll just be essentially a "conference call"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (If we had decided to meet via G+, then essentially I'd just startup a "Hangout", which is like a video ChatRoom, and you'd just login &amp; join that Hangout)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; to clarify a bit with G+, you'd sign in to G+ and you'd see a note that people are "hanging out" or "started a hangout" in your stream, then you just click to join the hangout (assuming you have the hangout software already installed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; jumping topics a bit, one of our librarians just forwarded a link to <a href="https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Mock-API-Web-Application">https://github.com/ORCID/ORCID-Mock-API-Web-Application</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How does G+ know that I care someone is hanging out somewhere?  I guess I would need a bunch of contacts.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, it's up to the person who starts the hangout to select what "circle" or "circles" to which to broadcast the invitation to hang out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- yea, you only see "hangouts" for your contacts.  So, if we did the G+ Hangout, you'd have to add me as a contact, or I'd have to make the hangout "public" and send you a link to it.</span><br />
