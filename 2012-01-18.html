<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; starting with DS-924</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; 924 -- looks like we need to bug Graham to see the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aha, yes, correct.  Tim will add a brief comment (after meeting) to pester Graham for the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; next up, DS-925</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-925">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-925</a> ] - [#DS-925] ItemImport does not delete items that weren&amp;#39;t placed into the archive - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks related to 924</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; this is the case where your batch of imports went to a collection with some type of workflow?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, needs to be linked back to DS-924, as these are connected</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-924">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-924</a> ] - [#DS-924] ItemImport should allow you to import to a workspace - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; might be worth asking Graham if he has a patch for this by now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, Tim can pester Graham on this one too.  We'll just move along for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; what would "correct" behavior do.. report accurately as to what happened, or pop these in-progress submissions out of the workflow, and delete them?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I use ItemImport loads... I'm guessing the in-progress / workflowed things need to be removed/deleted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; to be honest, I think 924 is related to some of the non-standard things that Symplectic do with DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, does anyone else see a use case for Ds-924 / Ds-925, or do we question the need for these altogether?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (honest question -- I personally have never needed to do either of these operations with batch import)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I meant 925 re Symplectic (not quite awake yet). I can see a use for 924, and 925 probably could do with some elaborating</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;  -w,--workflow      send submission through collection's workflow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; <a href="https://github.com/peterdietz/SAFBuilder/wiki/Basic-DSpace-Import-Process">https://github.com/peterdietz/SAFBuilder/wiki/Basic-DSpace-Import-Process</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Basic DSpace Import Process - GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/peterdietz/SAFBuilder/wiki/Basic-DSpace-Import-Process">https://github.com/peterdietz/SAFBuilder/wiki/Basic-DSpace-Import-Process</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 925 should be addressed, whether it is made to complete the action properly or fail it properly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I think he means to a specific workspace -- ie, make a specific user take the task</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I never import into the workflow, our batch-ingest materials are always ready-to-go-live</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so.. if one uses the -w option, then I'm guessing that these should just work.. I'd assign both to Graham, he's probably the most interested in them working anyways</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, well, it sounds like we better just follow up with Graham in both cases.  Both Ds-924 and Ds-925 need code (if available) and maybe more explanation around use cases</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- no, Ds-924 is related to *workspace* which is different than *workflow*.  "Workspace" is an item that hasn't yet been finished/submitted yet, if you recall</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; oh my bad too then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Recall, Item lifecycle goes:   "Workspace Item" (not finished) -&gt; "Workflow Item" (finished &amp; in workflow) -&gt; Archived Item</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; but assign both to Graham sounds like the best choice to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, Ds-924 and Ds-925: Followup with Graham on both (Tim will add a comment to each)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; next up, DS-927</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-927">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-927</a> ] - [#DS-927] REST-API All item submitter information is returned for an item request, even for an anonymous request. - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I like mhwood's rant on this one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; me too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to mhwood's comments.  Though, that may be a larger project, would it not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Definitely a larger project.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; When I was working on WebMVC UI, I ran into that same issue.. this code should be clear enough: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/webmvc/blob/master/webmvc-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/webmvc/controller/admin/ItemController.java#L93">https://github.com/DSpace/webmvc/blob/master/webmvc-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/webmvc/controller/admin/ItemController.java#L93</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ webmvc-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/webmvc/controller/admin/ItemController.java at master from DSpace/webmvc - GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/webmvc/blob/master/webmvc-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/webmvc/controller/admin/ItemController.java#L93">https://github.com/DSpace/webmvc/blob/master/webmvc-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/webmvc/controller/admin/ItemController.java#L93</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; What about the suggestion to just return a user identifier, and then some other bit of code can decide whether the client has access to details of that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd be fine with the approach to just return user identifier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; same here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; someone want to add a comment to that effect to this issue? sounds like we are in agreement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, the suggestion is already there....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right -- but a comment to say that we discussed this and that we all came to the conclusion that that suggestion is probably the best solution for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Kinda wish Mark Diggory were around.. I need to bug him about "business services".. i.e. some of the middle code that handles these once-and-for all problems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I don't mind adding a comment to this 927 issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; MDiggory is unable to attend today I'm afraid he has other obligations (I checked)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- go ahead and add a comment to the issue.  thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. we'll stop there for today with JIRA review.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The only other big topic I had for today was to start brainstorming out some things we may want to see happen in 3.0 (and potentially even get together some volunteers if we can find them).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Though, if we wanted, we also could chat about the "Business Services" idea (even if mdiggory cannot join us today).  Or we can shelve that for a later date</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* PeterDietz inserts subliminal message that all should learn some basics about Git.. the demo site is up at: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/demo.dspace.org">https://github.com/DSpace/demo.dspace.org</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (As I see "business services", i.e. shared logic across UIs, as a general concept that might be worth moving towards in 3.0, as much as we can do so)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue seconds that subliminal message.  ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; funny, I was just thinking how parts of the jira review could happen in pull requests on github :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 aschweer.  That has come to my mind as well -- that during a pull request, we essentially are doing basic "code reviews" or similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; that would be wild to have this much rapid feedback on one issue, all at once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; tdonohue: How much reused code do you have in the replication suite?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, information visibility is certainly a cross-cutting concern.  DSpace does not organize it very well IMHO.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; making heavy use of pull requests could be a big part of the answer to the question of how we'd coordinate our work with github</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notices two conversations going on at once here :)  Do we want to talk github, or do we want to talk Business Services?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I'm happy to stop talking github -- just wanted to put in this link for people who haven't got around to looking at github yet: <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Help.GitHub - Send pull requests ] - <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I move to discuss Business Services and loop back to github as needed (since we did talk github last week a bit, and have an upcoming mtg on Feb 29 to discuss possibly migrating to github)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks aschweer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, RE: business services + Replication Suite.  The Replication Suite doesn't really "reuse" any code at all, PeterDietz.  Though, it does wrap calls to some of the Packager/Crosswalks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In a way, the Replication Suite is a "re-envisioning" of how Packagers likely should have been built.  In a future stage, the Packagers/Crosswalks may end up "swallowed up" / refactored into that suite of tools</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (that's just conjecture right now -- no immediate plans to do so)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, this doesn't have so much to do with Business Services per say.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; gotcha, I was just wondering if you had noticed the code re-use problem in that (or other projects your working on)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; at this point, I've mostly noticed the code reuse issues when it comes to the UIs (XMLUI, JSPUI, LNI, OAI, SWORD)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; as there's a lot of hardcoded logic in each of the UIs, which really should/could be shared</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (as we all know)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...which also hits when you do something like REST, webmvc, &lt;insert-new-UI&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So we need to list the common concerns, so we know what to start factoring out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One concept we could start to think about is whether we could be making more use of REST as that "shared logic".   I.e. if most UIs primarily interacted via REST API, then they could share logic there.  However, that's obviously a large refactoring.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (sorry, jumped the gun a bit...mhwood is likely got the right approach here)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was just writing some solr queries in XMLUI, and since some queries are really slow.. I was thinking it would be nice to have XMLUI draw the page, and insert (do-ajax-request-here-to-API), then get progress spinners while it waits..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I worry about having code all over the place (or even just in REST) that needs to understand internals of DSpace objects.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- agreed.  Just looking at steps to move the code downward.  Ideally, if the code has nothing to do with organizing content for UI display, it *shouldn't* be at the UI level (rather it should be in a lower-level API)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...and for other developers getting started with DSpace, since there's no business methods around, the developer has to understand the internals of DSpace, before they get acclimated enough to use it.. i.e. high barrier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; this would include code like "logic to determine access rights" and similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- yep, agreed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We have infrastructure for access rights, but each UI decides what the rights mean.  Ugh.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; One of the OAI crosswalks (METS) I think exposes provenance... So, since the access is determined by each UI, you have to plug the leaks at each UI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the overarching problem here is that we really don't have a full "API" for dspace.   Sure, there's 'dspace-api', but in some areas its more related to infrastructure.  There is no single API that people can write UIs (or similar against) -- they are stuck having to actually look at an existing UI to write a new UI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Exactly.  Instead, there should be something central that decides whether the access token held by this session permits access to provenance.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Item seems like a good place to put that logic.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So what services does a UI need in order to fill its output with specific content?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And to implement UI operations?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think a UI needs the standard CRUD services (create/read/update/delete).  But, READ would include things like Search/Browse, and would also need to respect access rights.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; currently, I think the Access rights area and the Search/Browse that seem the most repetitive across UIs (at least from what I've seen)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC there are sites that want to be able to say:  "yes we have that; no you can't see it".  So READ and SEARCH are two different requests.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Embargo comes to mind.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I was lumping that all into an "access rights layer" which decides how to respond to your request (it may actually claim it "doesn't exist" if it's under embargo, or it may say "it does exist, but it's embargoed", based entirely on your access rights)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; again, I start to circle back to the idea of a true "REST API".  A true REST API should handle all this stuff for you, thus letting you not need to worry about it at the UI level.  Though, it's arguable which logic should actually be written into the REST API, and which should sit on the "layer" just below that REST interface.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; One question I have, is where to put this "common" business code. Right in "Item" was suggested, I wonder if it will be so clear</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I have a nagging feeling that a single "access rights layer" would have to know a lot about various objects.  Maybe that goes away when "metadata for all" comes in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ..so clear for all objects that you try to do stuff to. Submission is quite complex it has a dspace-api section, and each UI implements their own things from there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; from what I've seen in other frameworks, they'd use an Item (mainly a dumb data object) and an ItemController or ItemServiceProvider (or whatever) for "doing things with Items"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- I'd venture to guess that there's no single answer.  Some "common" logic may be something that is easily moved down to Item itself.  Other logic may not "fit" there, especially if it's more "doing things with Items" (like aschweer says)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; tdonohue +1 I also think it's a case-by-case thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; What sort of things would we do to an object that the object shouldn't need to understand?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ?? maybe what UsageEvents to fire afterwards? but we have that part worked out pretty well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Come to think of it, we might find that there isn't any real difference between Item, Collection, etc. w.r.t. cross-cutting concerns, and so the logic can be pushed all the way down to DSpaceObject.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; abstract DSO, Item might implement delete differently than Collection</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ask each child DSO (if any) to unlink itself from me, then unlink myself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; both are interesting ideas.  I think the concept here is to separate the Objects from the activities across Objects (e.g. Search/Browse/Filter/Sort/Batch Ingest/Batch Export and similar)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Bitstream has 0 child DSOs but can still unlink all 0 of them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I like the direction you are thinking mhwood.  Technically maybe everything really should just be a DSO, and "type" (Bitstream, Item, Collection) is a property on that DSO.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; though, that's a huge refactoring project :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* PeterDietz (~PeterDiet@peterdietz.lib.ohio-state.edu) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notices we are already over time.  But, this is an interesting discussion.  If folks need to head out feel free.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; mdiggory had some interesting comments on how the type system ought to work, but time ran out and the topic hasn't come up again, and I didn't yet quite grasp where he was going....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like maybe we need to try and schedule a "Special Topic Meeting" on the idea of Common Business Logic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (or generally, "refactoring towards Common Business Logic")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hmmm.  Site, Community, Collection, Item, Bundle, Bitstream are all DSOs now, yes?  Some of the weirdness is that DSO types have properties which ought to be in the metadata table instead, I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; metadata for everthing would be a step towards fixing that, wouldn't it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, I think so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, mhwood, those are all DSOs.  But, Metadata is not a DSO.  Neither is WorkSpaceItem nor WorkflowItem (oddly enough)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's an opportunity to revisit what is a property (in the OO sense) and what is a metadata field.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; tdonohue:  ah, yes.  I have some (re)reading to do....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, essentially I agree though.  It'd be nice to revisit DSOs and look closer at what is/is not a DSO and rethink/refactor as needed.  I do agree it'd be a good step towards the Metadata for Everything idea. (since all DSOs should likely have Metadata, but currently they do not)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, for example, MetadataField (or whatever) needs to be a DSO so it can participate in access control using the existing infrastructure.  Then the access controller could have a method that takes an array or list of fields plus a session's access token, and returns a collection of fields that may be presented to the user.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; technically, in my mind, anything that stores "content" should likely be a DSO.  Whether that content is a content file, metadata, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, we should be free to change the storage layer for a piece of information without changing its access control.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; exactly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; which to me almost suggests we might not want a monolithic DSO, but instead "favour composition over inheritance" -- interfaces like HasMetadata, Storable, AccessControlled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; then any "thing" can be composed of whatever combination of the interfaces, and to avoid code duplication have eg a delegate to a basic implementation of each of the applicable interfaces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Can we leverage the Java type system somehow so that we don't have to create another one?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I don't know enough about Annotations to tell whether they might be helpful for this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aschweer -- yea, I'd agree with that concept.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; RichardRodgers has taken to using Java Annotations more heavily in how he has setup the ReplicationTaskSuite.  I've started to follow suit there</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, that codebase may be something to look at as an example for how Annotations could be used</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; they're used in the curation system as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; actually -- those Annotations are in the CurationTaskSystem itself. my mistake :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, org.dspace.curate.* has defined several Annotations: Distributive, Mutative, Suspendable, etc. which help to define what a specific "task" does and can support</span><br />
