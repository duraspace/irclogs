<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, welcome. It's time for our weekly DSpace DevMtg.  Agenda at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2016-08-03">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2016-08-03</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DevMtg 2016-08-03 - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2016-08-03">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2016-08-03</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Sigh. Looks like we have a low attendance again this week. I'll have to email Committers and see when we expect people back (I know several who have been on vacation much of July, but have returned this week, I believe)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hopefully a few more folks pop in here to help things along, as we really could use more support in getting 6.0 out the door :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, I see mhwood &amp; terry-b3 are here.  helix84 is likely lurking (as his acct often is at this time of day)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; hello</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, as usual, the topic is 6.0.

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm assuming we could just continue that review process... unless anyone here has a question or topic to bring up prior to that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, not hearing any other topics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In the review over in #dspace, we last reviewed ticket 3266... so, next up is...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-3255</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3255">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3255</a> ] - [DS-3255] &amp;#39;dspace structure-builder&amp;#39; silently fails, logging Hibernate errors - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Based on the comments here, it sounds like it is unreproducible (at least so far)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: did you have any other ideas how you triggered this? Or should we close it as "unreproducible" until we can find someone who can actually reproduce it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, maybe there is something weird here.  Let's just close it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Or, if you have the XML you were using at the time, cwilper did mention he could test it again on his end.  If not, then it does seem like one to close</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've updated my list to revisit this later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. If you plan to revisit, I'll assign it to you. We can wait on closing it (for now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It seems like an uncommon use of DSpace, so if need be we can reschedule it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yes, true. It's probably just a matter of whether this is easily reproducible. If so, we figure out how/why.  If not, we assume it was a fluke and close it for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Moving along.. next up, DS-3243</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3243">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3243</a> ] - [DS-3243] Cannot resume authentication - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This is another we've had trouble reproducing.  But, I left it opened as it might need re-testing with Tomcat 8.  Is anyone in here using Tomcat 8 for development/testing?  This would be an easy thing to test out, if so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm currently on 7.  Would like to go to 8 but various things break.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Things "break" on master with Tomcat 8?  Or are you talking 5.x + Tomcat 8 being problematic?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's been too long, but probably both.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; we are not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood makes a note to keep better notes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, it'd be good to know (1) what breaks with Tomcat 8 (so we can log bugs and try to fix), and (2) if 3243 is one of those things that breaks only for Tomcat 8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But this one looks like it may have been fixed by another patch?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: did you see a related patch? I admit, I didn't, but maybe I overlooked a possible fix to this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hm, I'm remembering the opposite bug:  code expects to receive e.g. Integer but is getting UUID.  This is the other way 'round.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There were several of those *types* of bugs throughout the API when we first introduced UUIDs (in the great refactor). But, none that I recall in this area of the code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Those were in JSPUI, too, IIRC.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 3243 is XMLUI ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, sounds like someone should still give this a run with Tomcat 8. Maybe I can find time to install Tomcat 8 and try out this (and master in general), if no one else gets to it first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Also, those were in JSPUI, IIRC.  (And this is XMLUI.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Though if anyone else listening or reading this later is already using Tomcat 8, please do volunteer to give a quick test of DS-3243... and let us know if you are noticing any other Tomcat 8 bugs, please!)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've started "watching" the ticket, to keep in touch with it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, moving along for now.  DS-3234</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would say that, if you restart Tomcat, existing sessions should be trashed, but not this way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 3234 has a PR, DSPR#1468</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Very nice fix here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 3234 involves a lot of fixes / refactors to the migration process, both to support Flyway 4 and to revert back to migrating the DB whenever Tomcat start (or you run 'dspace database migrate'), which was 5.x behavior</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Config comment is much clearer now.  No other issues.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, since this is at +2, shall I merge it?  Does this need additional testing?  I admit to doing some extensive testing myself...and sounds like terry-b3 did as well (thanks Terry!)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Go for it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Go for it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Merging then. I'll make sure to update the documentation (with the new configuration) before closing out the ticket</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This one is actually a small fix to the 'start-handle-server' script packaged with DSpace.  Since the log.dir setting doesn't exist anymore, it needs to be hardcoded in that script (though it's easy to update as needed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Makes sense to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; this looks very simple to me</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think 1478 really just needs votes. It seems like a very obvious fix to me though, and I was able to both reproduce the current (obvious) bug, and ensure the fix works</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ah, this one again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I hope we can get some feedback on this quickly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think we should get pbecker's opinion here again... he's the one who has had the strongest opinions in the past.  Based on my past discussions with him though, I think this seems more "in line" with his desire</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; *desired solution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I added a note pinging pbecker on #1399.  Hopefully he can get back soonish</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I would also like to see this one resolved soon, obviously.  So, hopefully we can remind pbecker next time he pops into IRC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I will try to remember that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I agree.  Thanks for pining him</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The next ticket is also one for pbecker: DS-3190 (awaiting docs). I reminded pbecker of this last week, and he said it's still on his To-Do, and he's hoping to get it done soon.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The most recent comments (on each) note that this seems to *also* be an issue in 5.x.  So, it's nothing new.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It also can be supposedly resolved (temporarily) by reindexing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; If it is temporarily resolved with re-indexing, could it be that the event system is not properly configured/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; to send changes to the authority index?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Does "temporarily" mean that the same records are re-broken later, or that new records are broken when added?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b3: maybe. It's definitely a nice "guess" to check out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I'm actually not sure. Others seem to know more about this issue, so it might be worth adding as a comment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The latter suggests lost events.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I will look for the event documentation on the wiki and suggest that as a comment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm going to close 3156 as a duplicate I think (and copy over cwilper's comment to 3157).  As this is an existing issue (with a workaround), it seems like it could be rescheduled. But, volunteers/comments are still welcome, obviously.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I added my comment to 3157 with a link to the event dispatcher notes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Just closed 3156 in favor of 3157.  We'll keep 3157 on our list for now...but we could reschedule this one if it came down to it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I added my question about "temporarily".</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ticket is still in "code review needed".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The next one is in the same state... DS-3153.  I need to cut an RC3 to fully test the fix</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, both of these tickets look odd/misleading.  I'm going to move them back to "Accepted" state.  I want the reminder to validate these in an RC3, but they don't need "code review" anymore</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I understand.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I tested, but I cannot say my testing covered the full scope of this enhancement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This is a massive PR.  While I created it, 95% of the code was not written by me (this was/is Atmire code).  So, I gave it a +1 and tested it.  I see terry-b3 did the same</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; When a search term is not found, the UI feedback is unclear.  I could not tell if the search failed or if there were no results.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This feature frankly doesn't work on master (currently).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; With this PR, the results found were improved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b3: yes, the feature itself may still not be perfect (and could use UI improvements).  But, without the PR, it doesn't work at all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; OK, that makes me more confident in my +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, improvement is good.  It unmasks further desirable work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Are there any objections to just merging this (as it technically is at +2)?   Should we look for yet another tester (as the code changes are too large to easily review)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; No objection.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Go for it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We need to get this out there in even semi-working condition to get more experience.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, the improvement is definitely good.  It ensures the feature actually does work, though the user experience may still not be 100% ideal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, I'm merging it then. Thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Nobody will be commenting on the UX if there is no UX because it doesn't work. :-/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Good point!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we're now at the top of the hour. There's a few more in our list, but we could leave them for next week (I admit, I have other things to finish up before I head out for the day)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I should leave promptly.</span><br />
