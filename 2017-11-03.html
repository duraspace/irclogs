<span class="irc-date">[9:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;sven&gt; Regarding item-submission and submission-definition, and input-forms as well. Will it be possible to have a better mapping than the current &lt;submission-map&gt; and &lt;form-map&gt; ? Especially will inheritance be implemented ? "chicken and the egg dilemma" :slightly_smiling_face: which was first. I am thinking about a runtime configuration when a collection is added it inherits the submission and  form definitions. Or </span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[9:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; metadata for a collection in which the submission-definition and form-map is linked.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;sulfrian&gt; Yes, I also would prefer to manage the submission-definition as part of the collection metadata. Especially when sharing the submission-definition between multiple (test) systems with a different collection/community structure it would be a lot of easier, if the mapping would be attached to the collection.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[10:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;sven&gt; @sulfrian Ofc multiple test systems with different structures is a big point. If there can be a handy solution in dspace7 could be a huge win.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; RE: the DSpace 7 submission config changes...they are discussed in more detail on this wiki page: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Configuration+changes+in+the+submission+process">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Configuration+changes+in+the+submission+process</a>  To clarify, in DSpace 7 we are *not* attempting to recreate / redesign submission configuration (as that's a massive endeavor itself). We are simply _tweaking_ the existing configuration files to allow them to work better</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; more easily managed via a REST API and interact with an Angular UI).  Any larger scale configuration changes would have to wait until post-DSpace 7. We simply cannot change/fix everything in a single release ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;sven&gt; @tdonohue I understand the problem of too many changes at once.  I asked myself just a question if endpoints are written which result they probably can return. Returning inherited submission-definition , for my idea, could be worth implemented here and shall be possible to implement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-green">* helix84 (~ctenar@unaffiliated/helix84) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @sven: this work is all still "in progress" on DSpace 7. So, feedback is welcome. As noted, the latest info on the configuration redesign is at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Configuration+changes+in+the+submission+process">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Configuration+changes+in+the+submission+process</a>   And, if you'd like to see the latest design for the REST endpoints, take a look at the `/api/config/submission*` endpoints described in the REST contract:</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot1&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; This all is very much a work in progress though, and it could change as the code development progresses. But, that's the latest ideas so far, and we do welcome feedback</span><br />
