But, he feels that 5.2 is in a state that we can release it on May 14 (which was the tentative date we set a few weeks back)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; From what I can tell, our biggest bug (DS-2486) looks to be resolved (it was accepted &amp; merged).  But, I'm not sure if anyone wrote documentation yet?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I just deployed a site to 5.x (has the 5.2-ish SOLR reindex merge), and it all went smooth. So, I've got confidence in 5.2, as being the big-one, i.e. the minor release that will drive wider adoption</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not seeing any documentation for the SOLR reindex stuff (2486) in the 5.x docs. I'm assuming this isn't "automatic", right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Yeah, there will need to be documentation. Since everything in the upgrade process is so automated. Having to manually kick-off a reindex will require someone to run a command after the dust settles</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; gotcha. OK, I'm going to reopen 2486 then and ask for Docs.  It still seems very doable to get those docs this week, and still release next week</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I wonder if that should have a separate ticket, for 6.0?  Is the current sorting *wrong*, or just something that could be improved?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; "the display order of collections are determined by collection name only and collections of a community may be not come into line." that's what keiji wrote.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; which PR is he referring to then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm not sure I understand that fully.  I think it means that collection names should be sorted within community name?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not seeing a PR for 2545 created by zuki. Nor am I seeing his having commented on any recent PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm not sure I understand either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; To make it simple: the current issue is resolved by my PR. It was introduced by the solution for DS-1968.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; The PR for DS-1968 came from Keiji (DSPR#518).</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; There he wrote "Many universities use repository to disseminate their university bulletins in Japan. In these cases, they set a community as a bulletin and a collection as a issue, so there are many collections with the same name and you can not select a correct one with the name of collection only.

<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I think with his comment in DS-2545 wanted to say, that he *will* send another PR to repair the collection ordering.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; If Keiji's creates a PR this week I'm willing to review it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 2545 seems like a "good enough" fix that resolves the actual blocker. I'm perfectly fine with Keiji enhancing it, but it seems like the "enhancement" part need not hold up 5.2 (We can always do a 5.3 as needed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree.  Keiji's work sounds like a separate issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; If he doesn't send a PR this week, I think we should release 5.2 anyhow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I think we all agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Its important that the collection list dropdown is sorted properly. A:100, A:200, A:300, B:30, B:40, B:50, ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; where letter is community name, and number is collection number</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree with that too.  But it shouldn't hold up 2545.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; the question is, whether the sorting should hold up 5.2.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 5.2 seems like something we need to get out the door as there are major issues with upgrading to 5.x for *anyone* using Solr Stats.   Whereas, it doesn't seem like enhanced sorting is something that would affect *everyone* with the JSPUI (and likely could wait for 5.3)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.  Sort is inconvenient.  Stat.s are *broken*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think we merge 2545 as-is, and include it in 5.2.  Keiji's sorting enhancement should be a new ticket, and we'll merge it when it is ready (whether that is 5.2 or 5.3)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Are there any other major issues which we'd like to get into 5.2?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; What is master? Is that 6.x, or 5.x ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; master is 6.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; 5.x is dspace-5_x branch.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; master is 6.x.  But, just cause a PR is against "master" doesn't mean we wait until 6.x to release it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; So. 895 can get merged (into master), and then cherry-picked into 5.x for a 5.2 bug fix</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We tend to recommend that, if you are creating a PR, create it against *master* first.  We can then cherry-pick it over to dspace-5_x if we want to add into 5.x as well</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: correct, that's our normal PR process (unless someone provides us with two separate PRs)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; FWIW, I personally only ever create PRs against master (and then have them cherry-picked elsewhere).  Others create multiple PRs (which is fine too)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: I'm currently providing two sepearte PRs after I had a PR that needed some more backporting. Is this wanted or should I keep the "one pr" behavior?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; one PR is perfectly fine. If you want to create multiple you can...but we only really need *one* (and that one should be against "master" and we'll cherry-pick it anywhere else it needs to go)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In our "Development with Git" docs, we actually list either option as "fine".

<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: there's no way to cherry-pick from the github UI. You have to do it via commandline</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll see if I can also find an hour to chip in within the next few days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thanks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other specific issues to discuss with regards to 5.2?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK, sounds like none</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, with 5.2, it seems like we need to get any last PRs merged ASAP.  Likely by Friday, if we can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That'd give us much of next week to pull down the 5.x branch, and bang on it a bit, so that it's ready for release on Thurs, May 14</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, sounds like a plan then. I'll try to ping hpottinger about this later today (though I'm sure he'll also read these logs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Next topic is just another reminder.  I just wanted to note that the various Strategic Planning activities  / RoadMap development work has been going on behind the scenes (on the wiki).  I don't have anything specific to report beyond the brief notes in the agenda</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, much of this is also under review by the Steering Group, and as noted previously, we're prepping this all for much broader discussion at the OR15 conference (both during the Dev/DCAT meeting and during the interest group sessions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If there are any comments or questions, please do let me know. As noted before, you are also welcome to add your own thoughts/questions to the wiki pages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; will there be a stream or a protocoll or some other information from the Dev/DCAT meeting at OR15?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll pause momentarily just in case there are burning questions...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: there will be notes. I'm not sure if we'll have the ability to "stream" (doubtful).  Though if Internet speed is good (it's hard to tell as it's at a hotel), maybe someone could Skype you in if you'd like that'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I have to check timezones, but if possible I would come back to that offer.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Or someone could possibly open up a Google Hangout I guess, and "stream" it that way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The meeting is at 1:30pm - 5pm EDT.  It's probably quite late for you, but still let us know if you'd want to be brought in virtually in some way (even just for the first part of the mtg)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; no problem!  We'd love to find a way to include everyone obviously. At the very least, we'll take notes, and any slides I create I will share publicly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK, unfortunately we are running short on time. I'm going to have to leave abruptly in ~5mins for a DSpace Steering Group meeting.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; good to know. Will do so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; mhwood: While I know that 1348 won't work without 2497, I haven't tested 2497 without 1348. ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; so, if you encounter any problems within 2497, it might be solved in 1348.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm not sure what else to say at this point.  I was hoping to hear from someone who actually uses versioning.</span><br />
