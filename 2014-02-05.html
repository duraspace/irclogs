<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hello DSpace Developers.  It's time for our weekly Devel Mtg.  Today's agenda is at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-02-05">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-02-05</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Looks like a low attendance today, but hopefully others will at least be reading the logs (or perhaps even join up shortly)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First off, I wanted to be sure to remind us all that OR2014 proposals are *due* next Monday (Feb 10).  This includes proposals for the main conference, workshops, and also DSpace User Group sessions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; more info at: <a href="http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?p=392">http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?p=392</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Next up, I wanted to be sure to touch back on our 4.1 status.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Looks like as of today we still have ~13 tickets which are unresolved yet marked "fix for 4.1": <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS/fixforversion/11568">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS/fixforversion/11568</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that would imply the status is "we're still working on 4.1" and it's not quite ready.  But, I wasn't sure if there were any tickets that needed more immediate eyes today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I have one (DS-1531) waiting on comment, but I may just go ahead and pull it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yea, regarding DS-1531, it sounds like you verified that it was code that is not being used? (based on the last comment)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I see six others in "code review needed" status.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; DS-1898 is obvious, but it won't go to master, only to 4.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I mean it has a PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, Hardy asked Kevin VdV about the code in 1531 and he said it was leftovers.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I *don't* think we can tackle DS-1781 for 4.1 unless someone really deeply looks into this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-green">* kompewter (~kompewter@ec2-50-17-201-82.compute-1.amazonaws.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue just woke up kompewter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* helix84 is going to kick kompewter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; oh, thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-1531 sounds like it's "verified enough" then. So, seems good to merge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1531">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1531</a> ] - [DS-1531] bug in current DSpace (3.1) with log importing  - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Will do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; Then there's the question of DS-1821 - merge or reschedule?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1821">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1821</a> ] - [DS-1821] Internationalize the bitstream access icon alt text - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-1898 seems reasonable (at a glance)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1898">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1898</a> ] - [DS-1898] OAI not always closing contexts - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sorry, still catching up with the tickets mentioned above</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-1781 sounds like a possible "reschedule it" (as helix84 suggests)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1781">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1781</a> ] - [DS-1781] LDAP never uses the specified email_field - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 1898 looks right to me too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; just reminding you not to push the button on 1898, it needs to be cherry-picked instead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-1821 is the one I'm not sure about. Do we want to be adding new I18N keys in bug-fix releases?  Although it's a sort of "bug fix" it would require translators to update their translations (or else they'd get errors in the UI).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1821">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1821</a> ] - [DS-1821] Internationalize the bitstream access icon alt text - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I don't think it's much of an issue. We have only one or two translations updated for 4.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Errors consistof untranslated message key.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i.e. accepting changes like 1821 into a 4.1 would mean that 4.0 translations are not 100% compatible with 4.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yep, there's mine and there's pt_BR updated for 4.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, I see two...Czech &amp; pt_BR.  So, I guess that shouldn't be too big of a deal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; anyway, I would appreciate if someone would just test it once (I think I tested it with an older branch)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; *sigh* I need to learn how to exercise this I18N stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Might be helpful to know how/where to test it.  Is it the hover-over/alt text for access restricted bitstreams?  (Just not entirely sure which icon this is)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I really hope we can confirm the fix of DS-1536 for 3.x. But it's been confirmed for 4.x.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1536">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1536</a> ] - [DS-1536] having a DOT in handle prefix causes identifier.uri to be cut off when being created. - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; thanks, mhwood. it's the hover text over the restricted bistream icon.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; DS-1860 now has a PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1860">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1860</a> ] - [DS-1860] Community-list doesn&amp;#39;t show all collections - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 1536 - yes, we should minimally fix it for 4.x.  I do think this is also worth porting to 3.x.  It's unclear to me whether this really isn't working in 3.x, or if there were other issues at play?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; And I believe if we bug Andrea a bit, he can provide a PR for DS-1899</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1899">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1899</a> ] - [DS-1899] Spellchecking is not enabled by default on the whole site - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; It definitely is worth porting to 3.x. It only surfaces for those who use a handle prefix with a dot (e.g. 132456.1/123)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, regarding 1536, this sounds like it should be in 4.1.  It's been verified for 4.0.  It should be backported to 3.x too, though it's uncertain whether it fixes *all* the issues in 3.x (based on Hilton's comments)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, in my opinion, 1536 sounds like it's mergeable into master/4.x/3.x.  But 3.x may need more testing to see if other related errors exist there (that have been resolved somehow in 4.x)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It looks like Hilton Gibson will have some 3.x test results soon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I also have a SQL command that will find and fix the damage caused by 1536, pending verification from Hilton.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: yes, he said so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Regarding that SQL command. That would *NEED* to be advertised in 4.1 release notes / upgrade notes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; also 3.3 release notes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So 1536 can go into 4.1 now and 3.3 whenever.  3.3 isn't really a thing yet, is it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, and 3.3 release notes/upgrade notes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 1536 would warrant a 3.3 in my opinion.  We need not release 3.3 at the same time as 4.1, but we probably should at least follow 4.1 with a 3.3 shortly thereafter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 1536 is a major issue which blocks anyone using dots in their handles from upgrading to either 3.x or 4.x.  We've left them behind on 1.8.x and below</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: well there are pending fixes in the 3.x branch and I volunteered to do the docs stuff, so it's really a matter of running the mvn stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree that it's important.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Anyway, waiting on 3.x confirmation should not hold up inclusion in 4.1.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in terms of release priorities here though, 4.1 has highest priority.  3.3 is important as well, but not as important as 4.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; correct, we should merge this for 4.x and 3.x immediately.  We can release 4.1 with it...and then potentially wait on verification for 3.x.  It *sounds* like Hilton thinks it should work in 3.x now...but we should verify</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, 1536 just needs a volunteer to merge it...then we need verification from Hilton that everything is also OK on 3.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can push a button, and it looks like this is so small that porting to 3.x should be simple.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it'd need to be merged into master, 4.x and 3.x.  (three places total)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Will do.  Making note.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so, where were we here...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 1821, 1898, 1821, 1860, 1899.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; DS-1834 has a PR from Kevin that needs verification</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1834">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1834</a> ] - [DS-1834] Collection content source harvesting test does not check sets properly - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmm...another major issue (not mentioned yet): DS-1823</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1823">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1823</a> ] - [DS-1823] Move dspace.url to build.properties as an independent variable (default value in dspace.cfg can cause issues) - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I still think that's a change for a major release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think I agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And someone started discussion of an alternative approach.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and I like it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not sure I agree..it's causing issues because people are overlooking this "dspace.url" in dspace.cfg and it ends up improperly set to "/xmlui"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure I agree it's "for a major release"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, the alternative approach is good by me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: but that has been an issue for many releases now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; such a surprise change in config would cause some confusion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; in a minor release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: yes, it has, which means it also likely needs backporting.  Currently, this issue affects things like Google Scholar/Google coverage (as Sitemaps will work but will create invalid URLs, etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I guess at a minimum we could create clearer documentation around this possible misconfiguration. But, the reality here is that it's a major issue if you aren't aware that you need to go manually tweak the "dspace.url" setting in the final dspace.cfg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; if this were a minor config change... but it's one of the few most important config variables</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Clearer documentation now, something else later.  Sounds good enough?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I can understand both sides here.... it is a big change.  At a bare minimum we really need to change all of our Installation/Upgrade docs to warn folks of this misconfiguration.  Not sure if you've noticed, but this comes up time &amp; time again on our lists too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I only know, as a user, I wouldn't like this as a surprise change in a minor release. I usually do read release notes, but I think I'm the minority in that :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I guess docs is OK for now, but we need to update both 3.x and 4.x docs. We may want to create a docs ticket for that, and we REALLY need to be sure to fix this once and for all in 5.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Too bad that the stock setting doesn't break *obviously*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; nope, unfortunately a lot of stuff fails, and it all fails silently...eventually you tend to notice something odd (this manifests itself in many different ways on the lists as many different errors....try searching dspace-tech for "dspace.url" and you'll see a lot of different issues that are caused by this)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: the most frequent problems with dspace.url is that people leave a port or an IP there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; sorry, I'll have to go now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, I guess I can just create a Documentation ticket for 4.1...and we can leave it at that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I planned to tackle one of the tickets for 4.1 that weren't mentioned, don't remember off-hand which one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Another possible consideration for 4.1, DS-1596</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1596">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1596</a> ] - [DS-1596] Page not found look and feel - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, thanks tdonohue.  Thanks and goodbye for now, helix84.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 1596 would be nice to have.  It's not *critical* for 4.1.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not critical no...but it's definitely a longstanding issue worth resolving. I hadn't scheduled it for 4.1 yet myself, cause I wasn't sure if others wanted this in 4.1 or not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We are so few today :)  Not sure how to make much more headway on 4.1 without more heads/volunteers here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; True.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I was also wanting to talk about Google Summer of Code.  To see if we had interest in it this year.  But, again, we are too few to really dig into it much.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The US Midwest got clobbered with snow, so many may still be digging.  We got sent home at 1400 yesterday and won't open unti 1700 today.  (I'm at home.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm not sure if there's really much more to discuss today...as it sounds like it's now just you and I, mhwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, I think so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's past time.  Should we close the meeting?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yep, we may as well.  Hopefully we have more luck "organizing the troops" next week or via email! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I'll go see to pulling 1536 (three times).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'll keep IRC open in case something comes up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Just for the record (for anyone reading this later on).  If you are interested in having DuraSpace apply for Google Summer of Code projects, we need to generate some more ideas here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/DSpace+Summer+of+Code+Ideas">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/DSpace+Summer+of+Code+Ideas</a>  DuraSpace will not apply for GSoC unless we get sufficient project ideas &amp; mentor volunteers.</span><br />
