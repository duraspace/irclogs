<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hello all, welcome to our weekly DSpace DevMtg.  The agenda for today is at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2015-09-16">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2015-09-16</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As in recent weeks, we'll first begin with updates on the Service API refactor.  As of this morning, it looks like we still have work to do on both REST API and JSPUI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; For the JSPUI, as I noted on dspace-devel, I did split out a list of all subfolders so that individuals can claim them &amp; we can check them off when completed.  That list is at the top of this wiki page: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Service+based+api">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Service+based+api</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I can prob get the jsp’s to compile by next week ….. but I don’t want to keep pushing stuff on my own.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I also would like to add a sidenote that as of this morning, 'vagrant-dspace' is now fully compatible with the Service API refactor.  This means that it can be used as a testing/development tool.  <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/vagrant-dspace">https://github.com/DSpace/vagrant-dspace</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace/vagrant-dspace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/vagrant-dspace">https://github.com/DSpace/vagrant-dspace</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll admit, I was hampered this week when I found vagrant-dspace didn't work with the Service API (and I use vagrant-dspace frequently)...and I've been fixing it so that I can chip in more directly (and others can help *test* more easily)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV: You've done an amazing amount of work here.  I'm hoping to be more useful this week as well.  But, if you have time to help keep chipping away, you are still more than welcome to (but I hate to make this all rely on you...we need more helpers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; To claim a folder, just edit the list and add my name next to it, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well the last couple of days I was busy finishing the xml workflow migration (which I finished today, so I will have time for the JSPUI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: any updates on the REST API status?  Is that something you are working on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yep, the same as before. Just add your name next to a folder if you'll do it.  Some folders may already be partially complete (and I've yet to verify *which* ones as I wasn't able to fully test in vagrant-dspace)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Ps: on the jsp status, starting up intellij to see which folders I already fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; yeah. Sorry to be a bottle neck. I've been making improvements to it. I have been doing integration testing using BrunoNZ (Brazil), he had some bash scripts that create, edit, update, delete content, and it fails mid-way. Just weird context related errors</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; So I will claim those but leave the checkbox open</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: any timelines? We need something that compiles...currently everything actually "compiles" except REST :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I've focused at work on build spring-security-saml integration (for Shibboleth / ADFS to work native in DSpace), but have done some time on REST</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (so those testing are forced to do "-P -dspace-rest" and turn off the REST API to actually get a successful build of Services API)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I can make the fixes mentioned in the PR, and follow with improvements</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Box can be checked as soon as 'mvn clean package' succeeds, no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: please do make the immediate fixes ASAP. There's plenty of time for improvements (even post merger to "master")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I don’t think anybody expects a single person to test an entire web application</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; (Or so I hope)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV: definitely not. The goal right now is to get everything to *compile* and ensure that XMLUI &amp; JSPUI are "minimally functional" (i.e. don't immediately break).  More detailed testing can be done later on, and no one individual will be expected to fully test a webapp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Essentially, I'd just like us to have a codebase that "seems to be working well enough"... and we can then do more detailed testing to fix the minor bugs/issues that have popped up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Are there any other updates to share on Services API work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; KevinVdV: what is wrong with removing dspaceobject.update() ? <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1026#discussion_r39141648">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1026#discussion_r39141648</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Doesn't service make a commit as the action happens?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, and I did notice this one other PR (for RDF cleanup) sitting around: DSPR#1040  (probably should get in sometime soonish)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1040">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1040</a> ] - DS-2701: cleanup or org.dspace.rdf by pnbecker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would like to suggest:  if you see a good way to capture your testing as a mechanical approach, please write it down.  We need to create functional tests so that people don't have to create this stuff over and over manually.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; The update triggers the actions, <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/DS-2701-service-api/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/content/CollectionServiceImpl.java#L573">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/DS-2701-service-api/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/content/CollectionServiceImpl.java#L573</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Which are then processed on context.commit to reindex if needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other questions/concerns regarding Services API stuff?  We can take as much time as we need today on this...(as it is highest priority by far)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So what is blocking the merge?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; The jsp files &amp; the rest api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: REST API doesn't compile</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And JSP files are broken (while JSPUI compiles, it throws immediate errors if you bring it up)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Please claim the jsp file folders &amp; those not claimed after the weekend I will TRY to fix for next week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; So that we can finish the JSPUI next week before/during the meeting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, any JSP throwing errors is a blocker?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: It'd be nice to get JSPUI "minimally functional".  I'm not saying it needs to be 100% perfect.  But, we should be able to do common tasks...it shouldn't explode :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12960926/is-there-a-way-to-compile-all-jsp-files-in-intellij-idea">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12960926/is-there-a-way-to-compile-all-jsp-files-in-intellij-idea</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ java - Is there a way to compile all JSP files in IntelliJ IDEA? - Stack Overflow ] - <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12960926/is-there-a-way-to-compile-all-jsp-files-in-intellij-idea">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12960926/is-there-a-way-to-compile-all-jsp-files-in-intellij-idea</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Given the nature of the beast, that could take some time.  The tools don't help nearly as much with embedded Java.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, with regards to both XMLUI and JSPUI, we just need something that PR-builders can actually build PRs against.  If we give them an "exploding" UI, it hurts EVERYONE who is trying to pass us PRs for 6.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; untested though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, do we have a plan for the next few days here?  peterdietz, do you see a "fixed" REST API (at least compilable, minimally usable) possible by early next week?   Anyone else willing to help claim some JSPs to fix up? (hint: vagrant-dspace can help you spin up a test instance quickly now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I will try to clear some time to work on JSP, but it's been forever since I've done any of that....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I will attempt to get all unclaimed jsp’s to compile by next week…. all help is appriciated ofc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; i will focus on REST, my heavy weight of SAML is completed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll also do my best to help chip in on JSPs this week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Make sure to claim a folder before starting, so we don’t do duplicate work :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; definitely.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I already indicated the ones I have started/finished on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Sounds like a plan then. Any final thoughts/questions on this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hearing none...next topic for today.  DSpace 6.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I don't have much to really say here, but wanted to see if anyone has topics for DSpace 6.  Currently, it seems like Services API is eating up most/all of our efforts on 6 (which doesn't bode well for our 6.0 timelines thus far).  But, there's no way around it right nwo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-green">* aschweer (~andrea@239.73.69.111.dynamic.snap.net.nz) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That is my impression as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will mention that I still *hope* to have a refactored ConfigurationService (to use Apache Commons Config) ready for 6.0. But, it's been delayed by conflicts with Services API (early PR is out there though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Since anything else is likely to need rework.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; The service api will be bigest change in DSpace since the XMLUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I completely agree, KevinVdV. I  think it's much needed, and massive. I just wish it was "flashy" to end users :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, the sooner we get Service API done/ready, the sooner we can make sure we have a few other "flashy" looking features to get into this release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Agreed !</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (And I think we have plenty to choose from on our "wishlist" already: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+6.0+Status#DSpaceRelease6.0Status-WishlistforDSpace6.0">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+6.0+Status#DSpaceRelease6.0Status-WishlistforDSpace6.0</a> )</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC DS-1782 is addressed by Services work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1782">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1782</a> ] - [DS-1782] DSpace needs local object identifiers - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, mhwood. Service API comes with UUIDs now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Yeah afraid I stole your thunder there ….</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that ticket could be changed to link up to 2701</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Eh, as long as it's done somehow, I can fix an old SWORD ticket.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The only other topic on today's agenda is just a reminder/notice about the DSpace UI Prototype Challenge (just announced this week): <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+UI+Prototype+Challenge">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+UI+Prototype+Challenge</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace UI Prototype Challenge - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+UI+Prototype+Challenge">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+UI+Prototype+Challenge</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I don't have anything else to say regarding the Prototype Challenge. But, if there are questions, I'd be glad to answer them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (And yes, it's yet another thing for us to play around with this Fall/Winter... I wish the timelines could be different, but it's going to be a busy end of year it seems)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I hope we get lots of good submissions. Perhaps one will get blessed and be an officially supported UI, others can join a pile of alternatives, I'm hoping for drupal dspace module, wordpress dspace module, php dspace sdk, java dspace sdk, python sdk, etc...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That's it for topics for today. Anyone have anything else you'd like to discuss or brainstorm?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: yep, we already have a handful of folks who've signed up immediately :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I've heard so many great ideas for some value added service "on top of DSpace", that today, are too difficult to even get started. Well first, build your own client framework for consuming DSpace content... :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ds-1782 has a task for generating UUIDs on existing objects, which might be adaptable.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; But.. To have our dspace-frontend-starter, and then change things to have video playback button, larger icons, faces for authors, etc, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've been kidding myself that I might try my hand at a JSF UI, for the learning experience.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; some more eyes on DS-2699 would be great. Essentially, search is pretty broken in 5.3. My PR has been tested by at least 2 institutions for XMLUI and it appears to work better, but it still needs to be ported to JSPUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2699">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2699</a> ] - [DS-2699] Search not working as expected - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; and it's entirely possible that my approach is fundamentally not right, so it'd be great to have someone else look at it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; basically, I added a fix to 5.2 that allowed search queries to contain a colon-space sequence and auto-escaped that so solr didn't treat it as a fielded search</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; my original fix broke all sorts of things, so tdonohue put a fix into 5.3 to sort that out. unfortunately I think that fix is a bit too keen and now you can't really do any searches with more than 1 word</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aschweer: ugh.  I'm not sure if I'll have time in the very near future to play with that again.  But, will let you know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; thanks tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It might be helpful to link that PR up with the one that "broke things".  I just want to see the overall "trend" here...maybe there's a clue to a "right way".  It seems like we've now broken this in so many different ways previously (thinking that we had it fixed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; will do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aha, found it. Here's the one from me that was in 5.3: DSPR#981</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; which in turn fixed the problem introduced by <a href="https://github.com/tdonohue/DSpace/commit/2575d73b2d5f2dd00f80c7903c0b8dbf788e4d9e">https://github.com/tdonohue/DSpace/commit/2575d73b2d5f2dd00f80c7903c0b8dbf788e4d9e</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It seems very odd to me that your new PR (DSPR#1045) seems to revert back to the same colon (":") escaping that caused the initial broken Browse-by-Title/Date.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1045">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1045</a> ] - Ds 2699 improve search by aschweer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; which came from my DSPR#944</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/944">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/944</a> ] - DS-2461 Escape some colons in queries by aschweer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; well part of the problem is that we don't want to escape anything other than colons in colon-space sequences</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, that colon (":") escaping is now in a new location...so maybe that helps...dunno</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; my new PR uses a StringUtils replace, which doesn't use regex</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Time to take a step back and think again about what we are trying to provide?  I get the feeling that we may have to have more information from the user to figure out what the Right Thing is.  Is this an innocent user making a plain string query, or a Lucene expert trying to do something fancy?  We may not be able to satisfy both with a single approach.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; the nice thing is that if we replace it only in the query string that comes from the user, if it's colon-space we can be pretty sure they don't want to do a fielded search IMHO</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; generally, it's someone who pasted in a full / partial item title and expects that item to come up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; at least that's what my users have been telling me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, just a thought.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood no it's good you're asking this, and this is why I think fresh eyes would be good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I _think_ doing that one escape will improve UX without breaking anything, but I may very well be wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; right now in 5.3, you can't even explicitly specify the boolean operator / do a phrase search</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aschweer: one immediate "sanity check" would be to ensure your fix doesn't again break Browse-by-Title/Date.  I'm assuming it must not..but that was the initial colon escaping issue we hit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; tdonohue: yup I've tested that and it's fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I figured you had. Just wanted to be sure we didn't revert back to a state where DS-2602 existed again :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2602">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2602</a> ] - [DS-2602] Clicking on a letter when browsing by title or year when browsing by date does not work - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; the problem with my initial PR was that I had been doing the escaping in a different layer (directly in XMLUI) for my repos, then transferred the escaping to the Discovery layer for the PR without fully testing it. That's why it broke.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. yea, that makes some sense.  And then I fixed the "layer" issue, but wrongly escaped more chars :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; exactly :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that all makes sense in my head.  When I get a chance, I'll try and test out the latest PR.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; excellent, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As a sidenote, it seems like we have enough tiny/annoying bugs still in 5.x, that we might start to think about a 5.4 at some point.  I'm not trying to give us more work though...but if anyone wants to help lead that effort, it seems like there could be some quick fixes that could be added into it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah it's starting to sound like a 5.4 might be good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; some institutions with local customisations may hold off on upgrading to 6</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Odd idea:  instead of escaping stuff, should we encode it?  For example, index the title of something as "Colons&amp;#58;  Threat or Menace&amp;#63;" and then similarly encode the queries.  (That would require reindexing, of course.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep. I agree. I just don't know if a 5.4 will be "plausible" prior to 6.0...or if we'll have to have someone go back and do a 5.4 based on some of the 6.0 bug-fixes (post-6.0)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah I have a few more bugfix type things that I'm waiting until after the service api refactor so I can do a 5.x and a 6.x PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: one issue there would be if you'd miss some "hits"... would simply searching "Colons" still match "Colons&amp;#58;"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and I'm not sure how Solr would deal with all that encoded stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; it also feels like messing with the data a bit too much -- what would we gain by doing that that we don't get by escaping the colon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Good point.  I'm in a "try anything" mood due to banging my head against Ruby/Rails/Javascript all day.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah and I should probably be quiet since I did ask for fresh eyes on this :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was trying to think of a way to separate Solr's language from the data more strongly.  Brainstorming.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Needs to run, until next week.</span><br />
