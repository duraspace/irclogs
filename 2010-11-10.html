<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Today's agenda: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2010-11-10">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2010-11-10</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not really anything official on the agenda.  I mostly wanted to check in with everyone on 1.7 &amp; the Testathon this week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; evening all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if you have a topic/issue that you'd like to discuss and/or resolve, please feel free to bring it up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hi kshepherd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-green">* robint_ (5229fd08@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.41.253.8) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; tdonohue: stuart had some questions that he's pasted in #dspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; he's had to go to another meeting, unfortunately</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I've got something for people to be thinking about in the background, but I'll wait for 1.7 / testathon topics first...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (1:47:53 PM) stuartlewis: Is there a code freeze, or are we still ok to apply patches.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (1:47:59 PM) stuartlewis: The two I'm thinking of are:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (1:48:07 PM) stuartlewis: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-268">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-268</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (1:48:31 PM) stuartlewis: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-640">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-640</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it's great to see the maven issues are resolved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've pasted in the issues Stuart had mentioned -- I basically just told him we aren't under a code freeze, so code can be committed (as long as it is bug fixes)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd -- was there anything else in particular to discuss with what stuartlewis brought up?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i don't think so, they're just useful bugfixes -- 640 does what we'd agreed it should do in the JIRA notes / irc meeting, and 268 is just a useful patch to xmlui javascript</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; so if we're still able to commit bugfixes, we'll do some final testing and get those in shortly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok -- yea, in general, you can still commit bugfixes.   New features should not be committed (unless they've received some sort of prior approval of Peter Dietz)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anything else anyone wants to discuss with 1.7 and the Testathon?  Has everyone had some time to do testing? (activity seems a bit low so far, but then again, we did have those maven issues for a day or so)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint_&gt; I've been a bit stuck because of the Maven issues plus other wee hitches. How long does the Testathon officially last ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Testathon is officially till Sunday, but "unofficially" until 1.7 is actually released :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i think the feedback buttons are great -- maybe we need to promote them on the demo.dspace.org frontpage so people don't overlook them?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Richard Rodgers hopes he will have the virus-scan plugin by today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-green">* lepton (~Adium@host217-43-46-152.range217-43.btcentralplus.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sandsfish -- sounds good. it looks like it was just committed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Excellent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd -- we may need to talk with PeterDietz about that.  He did all the great work on demo.dspace.org -- and I'm actually not entirely sure how it is all setup (and don't want to accidentally break any of it) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It was PeterDietz idea to integrate/use "User Voice" (those feedback buttons) during the testathon -- he took the lead on all of that, and I think it looks great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i just hope enough people notice them and click them ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I hope so too -- they are bright red, so they should catch your eye</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So -- I'd encourage everyone to try and do some heavier testing for the rest of the week (if you can find some extra cycles) -- I know I plan to hit on Dspace 1.7 a bit more and look for issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I wonder if people are / do confuse them with the regular DSpace feedback? Especially when accessing Mirage, as it's a new L&amp;F, there isn't an expectation of where things should be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i've been doing testing locally (and quite a bit of it), but i can hammer demo.dspace.org if you'd prefer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; grahamtriggs: good point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hammer on whatever version you feel most comfortable with (local or demo.dspace.org) -- doesn't matter, as long as we're getting the testing in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; grahamtriggs: that could also be helped by a quick info pane on the demo.dspace.org page just explaining what the feedback buttons are and encouraging people to use them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Has there been any talk about stress-testing demo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Say, a simple JMeter profile, or some such?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd rather not directly stress test our only Testathon site during Testathon (in case you actually do manage to crash it completely) -- but, it would be good to stress test an instance or two of Dspace 1.7, or stress test demo.dspace.org next week (after Testathon is officially over)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; sandsfish: it's going to be fine, unless you load it up with half a million records and hammer pages at the end of the browse list :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So -- that's another way of saying, I'd appreciate it if someone would run JMeter against it.  Just a bit hesitant to do it this week, as the server itself is nothing amazing, and we don't want to put it out-of-service on accident</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; well, i'd be happy to bring up an EC2 box for 24-48 hours for us to stress test, though i don't have as much profiling experience as i ought to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; grahamtriggs: encouraging words, but after working with an instance that constantly has load issues.  tdonohue: i could run this after Testathon is over.  nothing complex.  just load and basic coverage of the UI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; any longer than 24-48 hours and the bill starts to add up though ;) i already have too many ec2 instances running :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sandsfish -- I'd appreciate it.  I think it'd be good to run a full stress test next week.  Would also be good to share your JMeter scripts on the wiki, so that we can try and make this a usual part of post or pre-Testathon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd -- thanks for the offer, though we could probably just use demo.dspace.org if we wait till next week (it's an EC2 server which we are already paying to keep up -- I just didn't want to accidentally crash it this week)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; tdonohue: sure thing.  my JMeter-fu is remedial at best, but i think it's worth it even just to see if an instance can get back on its feet without help after being pummeled with traffic to the point of not responding.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sandsfish -- sounds like a great plan.  I'd only ask that you let me know just before you start :)  that way I can help if any problems occur (but hopefully they will not)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; hehe, certainly.  will do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anything else anyone has to discuss?  (again, as mentioned, today's meeting is essentially an open agenda)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* grahamtriggs clears throat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; ok, this is really to put something into your minds rather than to discuss for today... you may have noticed in the commit logs, i've done a bit of work to resurrect the Freemarker UI project</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; (this isn't a point specifically about UIs though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint_&gt; phew !</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; if you've ever looked at it, you'll know that it's based on Spring's WebMVC framework, and that the controllers for handling requests are wired into a Spring context</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; now, it would seem ideal that you can just wire services from the Spring based service manager into those controllers - via Spring - rather than having to acquire them via hardcoding</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; dspace-services is still built in such a way that the Spring context it uses to manage the services is buried inside services code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; as a result, it's a separate Spring context from the one that wires the controllers, and so you can't just create a wiring point and expect Spring to wire them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I either need to pull through the services from the other context (there is some fairly ugly Spring wiring examples somewhere to grab the DSpace object and pull the services through into bean aliases that can be wired)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; or we do what I've felt should have been the case all along and pull that Spring context creation out of the services code and into the domain of the application startup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; yes, it means that you've got to define your application startup correctly, and yes, you can screw up that context definition - but then you can also make changes to it as necessary for your application, plugins, choice of services, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; so that's probably something we want to take a further look at following the release of 1.7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok -- that is good to think about / note.  Seems reasonable enough at a basic glance, but I'm unsure of its full implications at this time -- plus, it'd be good to get mdiggory in on this eventually, as he's obviously the primary expert, besides yourself, on dspace-services</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Bringing this stuff out where it can be found more easily has got to be a win.  What might we lose?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IOW what is the current design buying us?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; BTW, the webmvc / freemarker project in module now compiles and runs - and starts up the DSpace kernel / services - so it's actually at a point that you could conceivably get some functionality running on it!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i haven't used spring mvc for a while, but i didn't really enjoy the brief encounter i had with it ;) guess i'll have to try again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; agreed mhwood.  i'm in favor of simplicity and less spaghetti-like architecture.  though i must admit, i am fairly ignorant of Spring inner workings.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; Or you can just run it as it stands and go 'ooh' when the homepage changes look if you add the parameters ?theme=kubrick or ?theme=mirage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- likely there's nothing to lose.  I just haven't had a chance to look into it enough to see if it would have any implications on how dspace-services currently interacts with DSpace (doubtful, but I'd want to make sure, obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; tdonohue: the main point is you would need a bean that is 'factoryaware' being created, and seeding the points of static contact for legacy code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; grahamtriggs -- would you be willing to create a JIRA 'placeholder' for this problem/suggestion?  maybe even copy &amp; paste in this discussion?   It'd be good to track, so that we don't forget about it after 1.7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; kshepherd: webmvc is OK... it's a bit like Struts, but less annoying. It's not as flash or fancy as something like Seam or Cocoon, but then they have other headaches</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It looks like there is interest in doing this.  I must confess that I never did work out *why* kernel/services startup works the way it does.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 I think there is interest, just need to figure out what changes would be required and make sure it didn't accidentally break something else</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ...hence the need for a JIRA issue -- hint, hint grahamtriggs :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; yeah, yeah :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; btw -- grahamtriggs -- heard a rumor there was a nice pic of you in PeterDietz's 1.7 presentation at the mini-DSUG around the SPARC Repositories conference</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok -- any other topics?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; was there? I tried to live stream, but everything was blurry and there was no audio</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; grahamtriggs -- yea, I think he included your "James Bond" pic.  He was planning to highlight the underneath scalability/performance work that you've done with 1.7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yes, while we're talking about that:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; grahamtriggs++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; grahamtriggs ++ as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hear, hear.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; license to kill bugs and drive fast imports</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; also, mhwood++ for helping with the code cleanup that grahamtriggs started</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any other topics?  or should we close early today?  (I know I have plenty to get back too -- including trying to figure out why our Bamboo is consistently failing since yesterday)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; tdonohue: I think the bamboo agent needs a good cleaning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I think the fault is on the bamboo agent side -- not in our code.  just trying to figure out what it is :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok -- well, since everyone is silent, we'll close up early.   Again, try to take some time to help with testathon and/or bug fixes this week!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks all!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I had a similarly ridiculous issue with a Maven build the other day - had to clear out all the projects and the Maven repository before it worked properly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; bye all!  happy test-a-thon'ing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; cheers all</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; grahamtriggs: if you want to have a look at the responses to the ds-640 thing in #dspace, that'd be cool... if you still have objections then fair enough, but i'd quite like to commit it today ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint_&gt; grahamtriggs: I came across a comment in the wiki today describing that maven bug, did you add that ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; robint_: not put anything on the wiki - was probably Mark</span><br />
