<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hello all. It's time (15UTC) for our weekly DSpace Developers Meeting. Today's agenda: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-30">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-30</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DevMtg 2014-07-30 - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-30">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-30</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First and foremost, as it's a higher priority for 5.0 (at least for the XMLUI), I know we have a few @mire folks in the room to talk about the Mirage 2 contribution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I figured we could start there for today... here's the ticket: DS-2052</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2052">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2052</a> ] - [DS-2052] Mirage 2 Responsive theme for the XMLUI - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; Thanks Tim</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; No problem. I'll hand things over to you, bram-atmire</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; As part of the Mirage 2 development process I’ve been mainly dealing with communication and our early adopter group.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; I am joined here today by two key members of our team:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; artlowel is Mirage 2’s main design lead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; Hi!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and responsible for taking the hard picks in terms of technologies, frameworks etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; welcome, artlowel!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; roeland is our maven wizard who has done several inventive additions to the specific Mirage 2 build process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; Hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and welcome, roeland!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; The reason why we wanted to bring Mirage 2 to this table today, is because we would like to see the pull request accepted as soon as possible</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; the reason is that we have a few other contributions in store</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; for which we’d like to provide Mirage 2 UI compatibility</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Mirage2 PR is DSPR#587</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/587">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/587</a> ] - [DS-2052] @mire Mirage 2 Contribution by KevinVdV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and it would be a lot easier if we could develop &amp; finalize them on the current master branch, with mirage 2 included</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; so apart from general Q&amp;A on how we approached specific challlenges, we’re mainly looking for questions and criticism to see if we need to change anything to the pull request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; as it currently stands</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, as it stands, Mirage2 is it's own "top-level" Maven project, right... at [src]/dspace-mirage2/ ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; correct!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; we’ve changed this after the feedback on our initial approach to put it under /dspace/modules</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I guess the obvious question is... What advantages are there to putting it at the top level, *instead* of embedding under [src]/dspace-xmlui/ somewhere (since it obviously is XMLUI specific)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One detriment I can see is that it could be confused as being "generic" (XMLUI or JSPUI) if folks see it at the top-level</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (which obviously would be a misunderstanding we'd like to avoid)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; The main reason we put it there is to not to bloat the xmlui pom.xml with a feature not all of us want to use initially and which is rather complex.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; roeland: not sure I understand that as a reason... That would imply that it sitting at [src]/dspace-xmlui/ may "bloat" the top-level (i.e. [src]/pom.xml) instead?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-green">* wtantzen (8654719a@gateway/web/freenode/ip.134.84.113.154) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; err..sitting at [src]/dspace-mirage2/ I mean</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I.e. it seems like the dspace-mirage2 POM itself should be the one that handles dependencies for Mirage2... Sure, there would likely need to be a custom Maven profile (or similar) in the dspace-xmlui POM, but I don't understand how that would "bloat" it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; I think the idea is that, if we were to include it in dspace-xmlui, more code in that pom would refer to mirage 2 than to other xmlui stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; The same stack of tools would be useful for *any* of the theme approaches, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; not right away ofc, but yes, with some tweaking</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; oh hi, morning meeting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think I'm OK with "bloat" in dspace-xmlui, if the tools are generally useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, overall, I think Mirage 2 is looking good. But, I'm not yet convinced that it should be a top-level project....I worry about the precedence this begins.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I.e. I really don't want to see a ton of top-level projects under [src], especially if they are highly dependent on another top-level project</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; If you would put a fully built mirage2 into the /dspace-xmlui pom it would also encourage people to edit the generated css files, which is a bad practice. Putting it in the top level, we encourage using the override/overlay mechanism to customize mirage2.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's the way Maven wants to do it:  parent-pom, all dependencies one level down.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; We've been using the compiled version of mirage2, and keep it in dspace-xmlui/src/main/webapp/themes/Mirage2, we've been pretty happy with it there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; Thats fine for people running a dspace instance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; but we don’t want people contributing to dspace to edit compiled files instead of the soure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-green">* uhusiano (2948d782@gateway/web/freenode/ip.41.72.215.130) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm still not sure why XMLUI + Mirage2 cannot be more like how the LNI project is organized...e.g. [src]/dspace-lni/ is the toplevel project, but within it there's a [src]/dspace-lni/dspace-lni-client/ project which is the sample LNI specific client</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I.e. why can't we put the *full source* of Mirage 2 at [src]/dspace-xmlui/dspace-mirage2/ ?  And just build it from *there* instead?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; But we can save a lot of complexity, if we keep both the source/compiled css in the mirage2 theme. i.e. css/file1.sass ... file10.sass, and then you compile those to css/combined.css. Have a big notice at the top of that combined.css file that says edit file1.sass, and run sass --watch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we can just add the generated css to .gitignore...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; Of course people should edit the source and not the compiled files, but this can be achieved only by knowledge (or documentation) and is not depend where the files are located. If people edit compiled files in dspace-xmlui/... they would do the same in /dspace-mirage2/... Wouldn't they?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; (I prefer to have my compiled css in VCS, I don't want a site that we deploy to, to not have CSS lying around).. Sorry if we're bike shedding on location. But Mirage2 is a great contribution, a solid advancement for the user interface</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; as it is now, compiled css is never located in the source folders</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; only in the target folders</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;artlowel&gt; you can’t accidently commit it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Actually dspace-lni-client should move up.  It works, but it's bending Maven a little.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: why is it "bending" Maven?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Maven doesn't much care how many levels of subfolders you have...it just needs to know which ones to build.... In the case of 'dspace-lni-client', it's merely placed at '[src]/dspace-lni/dspace-lni-client' for human purposes...to make it clear that it's a part of the larger project.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's one of those things that Maven expects in the layout.  What we do still works but I would not be shocked if if it stopped after some future Maven upgrade.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh, well, that's a digression.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; @tdonohue that we could indeed do: make a dspace-xmlui module and two submodules dspace-xmlui-webapp and dspace-mirage2.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Compiled files should be in a generated-source/something, which ought to be a clue for people looking for what to edit.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; This would imply that that dspace-xmlui in itself will become a container and not a WAR of its own.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; roeland &amp; bram-atmire: no, you misunderstand me. You need not make two submodules... Look at how dspace-lni works... [src]/dspace-lni is a WAR project, but [src]/dspace-lni/dspace-lni-client/ is a JAR.  They are *both* built by this profile in the main POM: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/pom.xml#L477">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/pom.xml#L477</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace/pom.xml at master · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/pom.xml#L477">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/pom.xml#L477</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; ok, I guess we should be dissecting this project too much, but an overview of mirage2-source is that it uses sass to compile the stylesheets, and bower/grunt to manage javascript dependencies, fetching, and minifying</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; peterdietz meant to say: ok, I guess we shouldn't be dissecting this project too much, but an overview of mirage2-source is that it uses sass to compile the stylesheets, and bower/grunt to manage javascript dependencies, fetching, and minifying</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, it's possible to keep [src]/dspace-xmlui/ AS-IS...and just place 'dspace-mirage2' under that directory.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; that is the bend mhwood was referring to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; By adding mirage2-source to DSpace, how much more complex is a fresh install of DSpace going to be? i.e. does this require that the installation also adds 4 local packages or so?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; roeland: ok, I see the point there... just not liking the other options either. hmmm...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; There are two modes, a mode that doesn’t require the extra dependencies to be installed locally. Node etc are downloaded and executed by maven</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; for developers, who do have the dependencies installed natively, can use the other mode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; where the build assumes that the dependencies are present</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; as a result, that build is significantly faster</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; after the build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; all that remains to deploy mirage, is the activation of the theme in xmlui.xconf and the aspect</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; roeland &amp; bram-atmire: perhaps another option regarding "where does the code sit" is to merely rename the toplevel project to [src]/dspace-xmlui-mirage2/  Yea, it's a bit of a mouthful, but at least that makes it clear it is ONLY for XMLUI, plus it groups it alphabetically next to [src]/dspace-xmlui/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; simple. I like it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; okay, so UniversityX that wants to use DSpace5 with mirage2, passes the flag, maven does everything (npm, bower, grunt, sass) to create the compiled theme. If they have xmlui.xconf configured to use this, then they get it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd be satisfied with that minor change in name</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; peterdietz: yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; How would you feel about also including mirage2-compiled in xmlui/themes/, for an alternative/simpler getting started....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; now that I'm thinking about it. Say we made a bug-fix to mirage2-source, we'd have to duplicate that fix into the shipped compiled version. Kind of annoying</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; technically that would be possible, but it’s unreadable because of the minification etc. It would also be a burden to keep that in sync</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Or, can mirage2-compiled just get pulled in as a Maven dependency via the overlay processes? Does it do that already?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Aha, should the stuff to be compiled be a separate dependency?  Then you can build your own, or just get the stock from Central?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i.e.  You have two options... have mirage2-compiled get pulled in as a Maven dependency (via overlays).... or install all the tools &amp; build it yourself (which is recommended if you really want to tweak)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I would prefer to not have an external thing, for what should be as simple as a theme</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; i.e. Nobody understood services when they lived outside of DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; DSpace's theme of the future shouldn't be so complicated, I hope we figure out the best way forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: Not sure we are talking about the same thing... If you download the "pre-compiled" release of DSpace from SourceForge, you are already pulling down things like pre-compiled WARs from Maven Central.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My question was just whether Mirage2 would be included in that.... Is it possible to *enable* Mirage2 in a "pre-compiled" release of DSpace (downloaded from SourceForage)?  Or do you *have* to build from source to use it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; my question (very similar to tdonohue, who types faster) is: how does the current PR (or the name-change-variant previously-discussed) work with overlays?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And if Mirage2 is *not* included in the "pre-compiled" DSpace releases...then that might be an issue here.... or we need to stop shipping "pre-compiled" releases as an option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; If you download the binary release the process remains the same.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If you aren't sure what I'm talking about..."pre-compiled" releases are those that are named dspace-4.2-release.[ext] here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dspace/files/DSpace%20Stable/4.2/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/dspace/files/DSpace%20Stable/4.2/</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; e.g. you can use mvn package -Dmirage2.on=true both on the source and the binary release</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; roeland: Binary releases only include [src]/dspace/ though... so there would be no [src]/dspace-xmlui-mirage2 directory (unless you changed the binary release scripts)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and that happens through the overlay principle:</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I have a question about mirage2 on more practical matters. Say I want to have 3 themes: Faculty-Mirage2, Thesis-Mirage2, and Gallery-Mirage2, in which I've made interesting customizations to each, such that they are distinct in features, and are distinct in colors. Where would one store their customized mirage2 themes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland&gt; that would be in dspace/modules/mirage2/src/main/webapp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: mirage2 supports overlays, as roeland notes...just like current XMLUI, etc.  So, mirage2 custom themes are similar to how you'd do a current mirage custom theme...except you'd put it under [src]/dspace/modules/mirage2/ instead of [src]/dspace/modules/xmlui/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I do still have possible concerns here about how this affects Releases (i.e. are we releasing Mirage2 to Maven Central? If so, that does change our Release requirements a tad...which is OK, but we'd need to note that).  But some of that we might be able to "fix" after the initial PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; good question peter, just discussing this here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; where it would be easiest to do would depend on whether you alter XSL or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; The target output will make your modules/mirage2/facultyMirage2 benefit from bug-fixes to the mirage2-source base(?)... I'm working part of it ou in my head too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; if it’s only colours, the entry for these specific themes could be part of the grunt build, in order to generate these different color schemes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; with differences in xsl, it may be better to keep them all in separate theme folders</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Might be best (simplest) to just advise people to always do separate theme folders?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Never mind, didn't read well enough.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; I think we’ll have to get back to you with a more easily configurable way to support the usecase for substantially different themes in the same repo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; by "separate theme folders" are you meaning that you'd copy [src]/dspace/modules/mirage2/ into a [src]/dspace/modules/faculty-mirage2/ folder?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; yeah, I was looking at lyncode's stuff as my starting point. His work essentially provides an alternative to configurationService that allows you to set further values, and the eventually a properties.save()</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; But there's nothing that actually uses that, so I have no idea if it is working. I've done some changes to it, to spring wire it up, and resolve some issues.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; My goal is part of this AdminFriendly idea, where perhaps an admin can actually change some things about their site from the UI.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I hope that the branch can produce intermediate development points that can be merged fairly frequently, so it doesn't grow too far away from master as some have.</span><br />
