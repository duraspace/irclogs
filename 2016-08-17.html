<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The main topic for today is obviously updates on 6.0... in the last week we had many issues closed out, but also a few more pop up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Before we jump into reviewing "Must Have" issues though, I wanted to pause to see if there's any other pressing topics to be discussed today?

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; starting at the top with a few new ones...first up, DS-3292</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3292">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3292</a> ] - [DS-3292] Delete item doesn&amp;#39;t work well in JSPUI - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; has PR: DSPR#1494 (from lap82)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1494">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1494</a> ] - [DS-3292] Delete the Item from EditItemServlet doesn&amp;#39;t work well by lap82</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap82&gt; hi all I'm here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; To me, this looks like an obvious bug...and the PR from lap82 looks like the correct fix.  We shouldn't be looping through all Collections simply to delete one item.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Agreed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; my suspicion is this was done this way to "work around" some other earlier issue in the API refactor that has since been fixed.  So, glad we stumbled on this issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; ItemService ought to know how to delete an Item.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Certainly UI code should not need to know those details.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap82&gt; No, I think that we have follow the old code style</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; lap82: perhaps...I didn't compare it with the old 5.x code :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I suspect that there is an additional bug that this fix will hide</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; if I remove an item from the unique collection where this item belong, the item should be deleted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; this is the logic behind the "old code" that iterate over all the collection, if it doesn't work we probably have a bug in the collection.removeItem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Either that or the removal should fail.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the old logic was to remove the item, we should be backward compatible here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: possibly, but I would expect that scenario *should be* tested in Unit Tests (or maybe we should check and add a Unit Test for this scenario)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Good enough.  We should have documentation somewhere of the expected interactions between model objects as they are created and deleted.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; Ok, I will try to put a junit here and verify the behaviour. lap82 PR still introduce a performance improvement other than make the code more clean</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I still agree this new logic looks right...the way deletions occur (in general) is a bit more automated via Hibernate (i.e. tighter relationships).  So, I'm hoping that there is not an additional hidden bug here :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I like the way it DRYs up the details of item deletion.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It would be nice to add a Unit and/or Integration test if you are concerned about specific scenarios.  I admit, I've been trying to make it a habit to do the same thing in my recent PRs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood ++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, moving along for now.  It sounds like we have a plan for 3292, may just need a quick tester (and/or unit tests)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-3287 is next (another new one this past week)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3287">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3287</a> ] - [DS-3287] ElasticSearch fails (does not work at all) - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I wrote some notes into the comments here as to what the problem is (and one possible solution).  Unfortunately, I'm not very knowledgeable on Elasticsearch, and haven't had time to dig into this (and may not have time this week)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've pinged PeterDietz (who wrote this code), but haven't heard from him yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone else here have much experience with Elasticsearch and/or want to look into this further?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; unfortunately, the lack of general understanding is one of the reason why we have deprecated the ES code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sorry, I'm not really up to speed on Solr, let alone ES.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My goal here would be to implement a "fix" here that essentially just lets you "export" your ES Stats to CSV...that way the "fix" can also be our migration tool to Solr Stats.  I just don't (yet) know how to do such an export from ES, so I'm hoping PeterDietz reappears to help us ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I think that we should wait for peter here. If we cannot fix it for 6.0 we can add it as known bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap82&gt; bollini++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: true, we could just warn ES Stats users that 6.0 won't work for them. Please wait for 6.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Do we know of any sites actually using ES currently?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ohio State does (where Peter Dietz worked when he wrote this).  Unsure of others...but we could ask on dspace-devel perhaps</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; for now, we'll wait on Peter a bit longer. If he doesn't respond, perhaps I'll email dspace-devel to see if we can find a different volunteer to help out.  In the meantime, I agree, we could simply release 6.0 and warn folks that ES Stats doesn't work  yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; moving along, DS-3277</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini claimed this one.  Any updates to share here? Or is this still in progress?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm looking to it. My issue here is that the author authority just work in xmlui and I'm not able to have the xmlui working inside eclipse</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; anyway, now I have access to the demo website and I can investigate further on the data to see if I'm able to catch the bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, sounds good. Let us know if you need help along the way, and thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Would it be difficult to write a test for it, to drive the code in a debugger if that's what you need?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; might be possible to write a test for, but we probably first need to figure out how to semi-reliably trigger it.  It is rampant on demo.dspace.org, so that might be the best place to find out what is going on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I guess that we need to understand which are the step to reproduce the bug to be able to write an unit test</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; True.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; this (3154) is just waiting on RC3 to "prove" it is fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: XMLUI 6 works in *NetBeans* (what I use)... I'd assume it should also work in Eclipse.  Some things that occasionally help... running "mvn clean install" (to ensure ~/.m2/ is fully populated)...and I think XMLUI needs a "dspace.dir" property passed in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, in NetBeans, I have to right click on the XMLUI project and ensure I set a "dspace.dir" property for that.  I'm not sure how to do the same in Eclipse</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok, so we have a plan for this one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it sounds like we have good movement here overall for 6.0.  We have PRs for most everything (or at least plans for PRs soon), it's just a matter of getting them all reviewed/tested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the goal for the next week is to get this list down to &lt;10 (currently at 15)...ideally we find time to get these all done (except docs), but I realize our group is still a bit small these days (lots of inactive committers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd *really* like to get an RC3 released next week (or end of Aug at the latest)...but I'd like to get a few more of the major PRs ready to go, so we can announce RC3 for testing (even if it has a few "known" minor issues left)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; which is the plan for a 5.6? after or before the 6.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My anticipation right now is that 5.6 would likely be around the same time as 6.0 (there's still a few tickets left for that, but not many).  If someone wants to help get that released *sooner*, I'm fine with that, but I'd need help from others (to get everything prepped and ready)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sorry, I've got to leave now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; otherwise, I might be able to find cycles myself to "cut" 5.6 around the same time as 6.0.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 'bye, all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, currently, my plan is to do them both around the same time...unless someone else is willing to take 5.6 and help move it forward more rapidly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood. bye!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My personal priority right now is getting 6.0 out the door, as I want to get work on the new 7.0 UI kicked off (before momentum on that starts to subside).  5.6 is still important, but it's fallen off my plate a bit as of late.</span><br />
