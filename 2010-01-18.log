<span class="irc-date">[4:30]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, just a quick heads up that the js spam is still at large, and we encourage you to NOT click any untrusted URLs as the attack will start a HTTP POST connection using your ip to spam further, this could result in a network ban for you. The blog has more information. Please be careful and show some consideration for your fellow ircers! Thank you.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[6:34]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, we're noticing that a lot of clients are flooding off due to autoresponding to repeated version requests, you may wish to set your client NOT to send replies as these replies are not rate limited. As an example; '/set -clear ctcp_version_response or /ignore *!*@* CTCPS' should work in Irssi. For any assistance please visit us in #freenode. Thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[6:36]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Duh! Apologies, that should be /set -clear ctcp_reply or /ignore *!*@* CTCPS for Irssi. -- These notices will continue during the attacks, as they are our only way of communicating with the user base, we understand its annoying to some and if you are bothered by them, feel free to '/ignore *!*@freenode/staff/* notice' </span><br />
