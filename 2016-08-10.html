<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Welcome all! It's time for our weekly DSpace DevMtg (agenda linked above).  We have a nice group here today!  Good to see a few Committers back in action after vacations, work transitions or just general summer busy-ness</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As in recent weeks, our goal is really to try and push forward 6.0.  We are striving to get this major release out the door as soon as we can (and as soon as we can resolve the outstanding "must have" bug fixes), so we can then move on to the new UI / prep for 7.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, today, I'd like to touch on where we are with 6.0...the "must have" list is getting smaller, and mostly we just need *testers* these days (with a few tickets that still need a volunteer or a finished PR)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Here's that "must have" list for 6.0: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DS%20AND%20priority%20in%20(Blocker%2C%20Critical%2C%20Major)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%206.0">https://jira.duraspace.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DS%20AND%20priority%20in%20(Blocker%2C%20Critical%2C%20Major)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%206.0</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It's also worth noting (before we jump into the "must haves") that we *also* are maintaining a list of "quick wins" for 6.0.  The "quick wins" are things we'd love to still get into 6.0, but they might end up rescheduled if no one helps move them forward.  Those tagged in GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A6.0+label%3A%22quick+win%22">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+milestone%3A6.0+label%3A%22quick+win%22</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, for those who are just getting back into DSpace again (after breaks, etc)... if there's a "quick win" you really want to see get in, please help drive that forward by testing it, etc.  Otherwise some of those might end up being rescheduled for 6.1 or later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, for today's meeting, I'm going to start with our list of 6.0 "must haves".  We could use help also in getting these specific tickets closed out, so let's take some time to do updates on each: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DS%20AND%20priority%20in%20(Blocker%2C%20Critical%2C%20Major)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%206.0">https://jira.duraspace.org/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20DS%20AND%20priority%20in%20(Blocker%2C%20Critical%2C%20Major)%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20Unresolved%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%206.0</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First on that list of "must haves"... DS-3277</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3277">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3277</a> ] - [DS-3277] Change in behavior: Handles are now minted based on `handle_id` internal table ID - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This ticket has a PR (DSPR#1479).  It is waiting for reviews / testing from others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1479">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1479</a> ] - DS-3277 : Create new &amp;#39;handle_id_seq&amp;#39; for handle_id column. Use &amp;#39;handle_seq&amp;#39; to mint new handles. by tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The basic issue here was that the "master" codebase *wrongly* changed the behavior of how Handles were minted. The PR reverts us back to what I believe is the correct behavior.  But, this could use a volunteer (or two) to test/review</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If anyone here is willing to give this a test or review, I'd appreciate it. Feel free to either assign the PR to yourself, or just test/review it and add comments to the PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap82&gt; ok mine, I will look into it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks, lap82. Much appreciated! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Moving along to next on the list... DS-3269 / DSPR#1471</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3269">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3269</a> ] - [DS-3269] Flyway &amp;quot;Out-of-order&amp;quot; migrations is enabled by default - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1471">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1471</a> ] - DS-3269: Disable Flyway out of order migrations. Also cleanup of XML Workflow enabling. by tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This fixes another change in behavior between 5.x and pre-6.x (master).  The PR reverts us back to disabling "out of order" migrations, which is the recommended setting of Flyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Again, it needs a volunteer (or two) to test or review it.  I believe the changes are correct, but needs feedback</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone interested in this one?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's on my list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I did also ping KevinVdV specifically on this one in the PR, but I haven't heard back from him. He was on vacation for a while as well though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sorry, was recopying my list since over half of it is scratched off.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, and I should pause here to note.. even if one individual volunteers in this meeting, I'd encourage *others* to still give these PRs quick reviews. If there's anything you disagree with, speak up (now or later on)...and if you like it, also add a comment to the PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; moving along for now..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; next up, DS-3266 / DSPR#1464</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This one has had some initial testing... a flaw was pointed out by aschweer in her initial tests. That flaw has since been fixed (and validated with new Integration Tests).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, this could use additional testing / reviews... as I don't think anyone has re-tested this since the flaw was resolved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The PR does come with extensive Integration Tests though to also prove out that the new code performs properly in the given scenarios.  aschweer just rightly noted one scenario that was initially *missing* from those original Integration Tests</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone interested in trying this out? (If not, I can also ping terry-b and aschweer to see if they can do followup re-testing)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, will ping them on the PR for now.  Again, others welcome to add thoughts into the PR itself</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This one needs re-verification. Been tested by a few others and seems to be un-reproducible.  mhwood, you volunteered to retest this. Are you still willing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Let us know if you need others to help re-test.  Thanks</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This one has undergone a ton of discussion on what constitutes a "handle" (see the PR comments).  I think it's nearing completion, and mhwood recently provided some Unit Tests to help prove the code works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There's a few remaining comments on the PR to resolve though (to enhance those unit tests, etc).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Those tests are just a framework.  They need to have the set of good/bad identifiers fleshed out.  tdonohue has made some good suggestions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think this one is still actively moving along. If others have thoughts to add, please do so in the PR.  But, at this point, there's still a few (minor) updates needed to the PR itself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If there's a pattern that you suspect is not handled properly, add it to the .properties and try it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood++ (yes, please check our assumptions on what is / should be a "valid handle" and add a comment to the PR as needed)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This one (3190) just requires documentation. pbecker knows that.  Nothing more to add regarding updates here</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This one is a known issue that also seems to affect 5.x (based on reports in comments).  It needs a volunteer to investigate... or we could potentially reschedule this one (if needed), since it isn't new to 6.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It also seems to have a temporary "workaround" (reindexing)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if anyone is interested in digging into this, please claim the ticket.  Otherwise, this is one we'll likely end up rescheduling / downgrading (since we've found it affects 5.x as well)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt;  we can fix for the JSPUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: sounds great!  To be clear, the problem *may* actually be in the Discovery API layer... so a fix for JSPUI may end up fixing XMLUI as well.

<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We need to either keep this one open until the rest of the javadoc is fixed, or start a new ticket to (a) fix the javadoc, and (b) remove the workaround which is added here.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can take that one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks mhwood!  If this is an issue, we may have to figure out if it's even *possible* to fix via code / migration...or if we have to document it as a "known" issue and tell people how to fix it in 5.x prior to upgrading.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, it feels like a "your database was broken already" issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, let me know if you find a way to reproduce it, and perhaps we can figure out the best path forward.</span><br />
