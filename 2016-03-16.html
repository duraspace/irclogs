<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's 2000 UTC.  Time for the weekly meeting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Currently there is a DuraSpace summit in DC? I think they shut down the Metro just for this event, no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There's no formal agenda this week unless someone else did one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ha, that must be the reason.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So we have the usual issue before us:  getting 6.0 out for testing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I'm not sure if this is the proper venue, but, we will want to cobble up security announcements / disclosure protocols</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd is here accidentally</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; kshepherd: here, as in cyberspace, or the duraspace summit?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; that would be quite the accident</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I don't have any news on any fronts, DS6, or DSpace UI meetings, I've missed the last few of those</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; good morning folks</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-green">* KevinVdV_ is now known as KevinVdV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; m≈çrena</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah I should sort myself out with a te reo course sometime</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; the logs say there isn't a formal agenda today?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was lucky to get an announcement out in two tries. :-(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I always get super confused when you guys have the DST change and it's all over all announcements -- we're not changing for another 10 days or so I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DST ends 03-Apr, says timeanddate.com</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; One idea we came up with today is that in response to the security announcement, not everyone was able to be notified, since they never signed up for the registry. Would some type of "phone home" built into DSpace that contacts a central registry be an idea worth pursuing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Might be worth first just adding a message somewhere about the registry, perhaps to the fresh_install output?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i was wondering about phone home... some people can be (rightly) wary of such things, though, so some really clear and limited scope for what it's actually used for would also be needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Perhaps, but I'd like to also see us just get the word out about the site registry, and be able to say "registered sites will be contacted in the event of an urgent security patch" or some such.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Also, Claudia's comments about making the registry more user friendly wrt updates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; we could add a launcher command that registers the DSpace instance in some sort of private way?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we could also have a ML for security</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I've just gone and registered a couple of my newer instances, and the registratiom form feels pretty clunky, especially when it comes to picking what "customisations"/modules you have enabled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; launcher command would be cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; that list feels very old, plus I'm sure less technical people might feel intimidated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; or even webui admin function</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We really need to be discussing this with Duraspace folk in the meeting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; agreed re, launcher and/or webui, plus discuss with Duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I know that at least one registry entry is very outdated. :-(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; just generally raise awareness / lower the threshold for adding to the registry + updating</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; right now, I can't even see for "my" entries who the contacts are</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; For Drupal, there's a security mailing list, and if you're not on it, and you're running Drupal, you're asking for trouble :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: that raises the same question though, doesn't it? How do people get on the list, how do they keep being reminded of its existence so they can change over who is subscribed when staffing changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But sites need to know what it's used for.  A promise to contact you with information you need soonest would give people a reason to volunteer that information.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hpottinger: yeh on the other hand, if you're a bad guy not running drupal, you'll probably still be on the list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; indeed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; kshepherd: but there isn't really anything stopping you from registering a fake, private DSpace instance on the registry, no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; True.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; perhaps we leverage our Jira user list?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; that's true too, but there's no real incentive or obvious reason to do that at this stage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; kshepherd: fair enough (plus I guess it's more effort than to just subscribe to a nice obvious "security announcements" ist)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (since it's not called the 'security contact list' etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; if we're talking phone home, how about the other direction? Something that checks some sort of Duraspace status page and pops up on the admin screens when there is a newer version / security thing? (would have to be used very very carefully)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Oh, yeah, Wordpress does that naggy thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah I was wondering how other big open source projects do this, Wordpress did come to mind</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Nexus does that too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; and nagios</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; drupal does it too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; so do Firefox and IntelliJ (they also auto-update, we won't be doing that anytime soon...)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Wordpress auto update is "fun"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; so maybe that's a pattern that people are used to, and feels less threatening than the phone home one? I mean to some extent making the request is still phoning home, but maybe it feels less invasive</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We may want to wait a little on rolling out technology to handle a largely human problem, until we have a process that we can point to and instructions on how to be included in early announcements.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; in the meantime, I'm guessing an e-mail to dspace-general with information about adding to / updating the registry would be good (might want to coordinate with Duraspace so they have staff available to work through a potential deluge)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep for sure. always good to discuss what other platforms do, which methods we like and why, etc., though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But we need to know what we can promise.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; a phone home is a phone home, even if the surface UI is comforting, we still have a new data source</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There's no formal process that I know of now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; What I could say today is "join the registry, it's a really good idea, trust me, you might get something some day."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: but there is still a difference between, say, sending "IP address XYZ is set up with base URL ABC, has the following UI/modules enabled, this DSpace version, these e-mail addresses set up in dspace.cfg), and just sending a much more generic "tell me the latest DSpace version" request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and also "please verify your entry, it is probably out of date"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; true, aschweer... we'd have to be sure what we're reporting back in our "phone home" is legal in all jurisdictions, too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There is an important point.  The current model does allow the registrant to be selective in what is revealed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We need answers to a few questions:  what is going to be done?  who is going to do it?  what information is needed to accomplish that?  Then we know what should be in the registry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; always good to figure out the requirements first ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And if there is a requirement for information that DSpace doesn't have, then registration can't be automatic.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Yeah there is a difference between "we just want a way to contact all DSpace sites" vs "It would be great to have more information about the distribution of versions, UIs, uptake of modules, geo location of installations, UI languages, ..."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well.  There is technical information, which could be gathered automatically.  (If enabled.)  And there is human information (in case of emergency, contact X) that requires human judgment and maintenance.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Those probably represent two separate processes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; agreed, which (like you said mhwood) is why it's so important to decide which problem/s we're trying to solve</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* KevinVdV (~KevinVdV@104.238.169.65) Quit (Quit: KevinVdV)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Hey, I hear there's a "summit" kind of thing going on right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's why the people we need in this discussion couldn't be here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; but, the cool thing is, *they* are all in the same place</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; let's delegate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; sounds like a plan</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; also worth considering, and watching my words here.. perhaps we don't necessarily want the registry to *display* (but perhaps still ask for/capture) so much detail about instances in case it can actually be used as a shortcut/assist to malicious people looking to target a certain module/ui/version etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; kshepherd++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Same place = stuck waiting for a WMATA bus?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; perhaps even just a ticky box thing of "register me, but don't show me publicly"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; kshepherd++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; aschweer++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I *think* that the registry already collects more than it shows.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mm probably true (i need to update!) - i think it also shows more than it needs to ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood: it certainly does (it collects contact details but doesn't show those, for example)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; most of the "maybe a bit much" fields are optional though, I think?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I feel, at this point, that "here we are, a bunch of technical people talking about administrative issues that we can't decide."  We should wrap this up soon and be ready to contribute technical ideas when there are some decisions, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood++</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We have a number of good useful thoughts logged.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; anyone want to volunteer to ping the Duraspace folks about this? Or do we think it's on their radar already?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I expect that Tim will read the log when he is able.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger waves to Future Tim.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And I have no doubt that it's being discussed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm going to keep being a pest about designing a procedure and documenting things.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sorry, I had a phone call that wouldn't wait.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, do we have any other topics that we need to discuss?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i have a random semi-off-topic question, if noone else has topics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Let's hear it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; random++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; who here uses Slack, and/or would be interested in trying out a dpace-committer Slack? it has all the chatiness of IRC, can make it invite only, but better for sharing links/images/etc, you can see the entire scrollback/log even if you were disconnected or only just joined the project, lots of integration to other thigns around the show, free...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We use it here.  I can't say I prefer it, but I'm usually in the minority on such things.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I use IRCCloud, to keep my irc connected. I just jumped on a bus, to commute home, and have wifi on laptop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; But yes, Slack is pretty good. I'm in 4 groups currently...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i was just wondering about it, particularly in the context of things that need a bit of a 'private team' approach, as opposed to just emails or invite only IRC etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Its a huge improvement over irc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we used to use Slack here, we moved to HipChat because it gave us more options for integrations</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I'd be happy to try Slack</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If we're going to do this, I'll be in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; maybe i'll send an email in a few days to get more opinions and if enough are keen we could try something out?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; We dumped hipchat, they've had some pretty crazy stability issues, we got down to the last straw, then the last straw came and went</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we're not very serious users, we mostly all lurk and let the robots talk to us (integrations)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; BTW I tried the Slack/IRC bridge thingy for a few days, but it created way too many tabs on Pidgin and I switched to the standalone client.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; main integration i use is slack/trello</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; the main one I use is TravisCI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and a home-grown one that pipes cron job output to a room</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ah, yes, I got all set up with Trello, and every once in a while I think, "I ought to go update that...."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so people will stop asking me "did the cron job run last night"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I am eager to try out slack, and I think I would appreciate a more robust client than what I am using for IRC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I used IRCCloud, some cloud service that let me not lose the thread, I actually just left the office, and just caught wifi on the bus</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* aschweer needs to run off - bye all</span><br />
