<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-green">* helix84 (a@195.113.97.174) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, it's time for our weekly DSpace Developers Mtg.   Sorry again for the lack of agenda this week -- it's obviously just 3.0 Release topics today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notices that our attendance seems rather small, but hopefully more folks will filter in..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, regarding 3.0, here's the issues that still remain open (including a few "blockers" still): <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;jqlQuery=project+%3D+DS+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%223.0%22+AND+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC">https://jira.duraspace.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;jqlQuery=project+%3D+DS+AND+fixVersion+%3D+%223.0%22+AND+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Though, I should note that between robint &amp; I, we have a fix for DS-1343 (one of the blockers) in Pull #119 : <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/119">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/119</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (just needs a button press)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, is there anything 3.0 specific that anyone would like to touch on here?  (Or am I just talking to myself so far....it's quiet thus far)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; after last week's discussion on DevMtg I adjusted the schedule to accomodate rc3 and start 2nd round of testathon, does everyone think we're on track?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; new 3.0 timeline is at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+3.0+Notes#DSpaceRelease3.0Notes-TimelineandProcessing">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+3.0+Notes#DSpaceRelease3.0Notes-TimelineandProcessing</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace Release 3.0 Notes - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+3.0+Notes#DSpaceRelease3.0Notes-TimelineandProcessing">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+3.0+Notes#DSpaceRelease3.0Notes-TimelineandProcessing</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we'll need someone to actually do the rc3 release by the end of the week so that we can have t ondemo by Monday (testathon starts)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i still don't feel up to it, what about you, Hardy?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue would suggest doing the rc3 release on Thurs (tomorrow) if possible...just so you have Friday as a "backup release day", in case issues happen on Thurs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i should be able to update demo again, say on Sunday night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes however that the build/release process has gotten a LOT of cleaning since rc1, so it should go MUCH more smoothly (I hope)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tim, remember our talk about testing release of the -lang projects?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- yep, I recall. Those need some "love" &amp; a release as well.  I just haven't gotten too it, as I've been bogged down with cleaning up the main POMs so that the main release worked right :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I noticed - big thanks for that!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; No problem.  The changes to the -lang projects should be MUCH smaller, as they include no Java code.  Essentially their POMs just need minor updates to point at GitHub instead of SVN, and then we need to do a Release.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; seems awfully quiet here today, anyone alive? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; No.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It seems like just two of us, helix84</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; oh, oh, mhwood turned into a zombie</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It *is* Hallowe'en....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kill -9 mhwood_zombie</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ps -developers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood [DEFUNCT} 98774</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: that wouldn't work :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I guess it may not... oh well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; okay, i guess we're tired talking about the release, mind if I start a fresh topic?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; BRAAAAINSSS?  OK | DISMISS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I do have a small point to bring up regarding the release testing still though...mainly a simple question:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; sure, that's our main topic, please go ahead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Has anyone tested the "AIP Backup &amp; Restore" functionality?  I've been meaning to get around to it, but haven't.  I'm slightly worried that it may not work anymore with all the new Item Versioning stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i didn't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (So, that's just a warning, that we may have a "Blocker" there, waiting to be discovered.  I hope to test it tomorrow, if I don't get to it just after this mtg)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Not here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok.  Well, I'll try and get to it myself then.  I'm hoping there's not a blocker there...but, I noticed today that the code didn't get an update alongside the Item Versioning stuff, and based on that, I worry it may be broken</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'm going to fix two easy issues with XMLUI - the CC license link and the Mobile theme</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 helix84 sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt;  /seen mdiggory lately?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; nope. he's been nearly non-existent on IRC these days.... just seen him in email &amp; github</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I was hoping he could help with the <a href="http://example.com/mobile/">http://example.com/mobile/</a> URL - Cocoon stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ IANA — Example domains ] - <a href="http://example.com/mobile/">http://example.com/mobile/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; you might want to email him to see if he has ideas/thoughts.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood notes that Ds-1182 stands Open although fix is merged, to invite confirmation that it is fixed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; will do, I have very low success rate with that, though :D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; &gt; Per Joao's wish, reopening so that we keep it on the radar at least until 3.0 release.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- could also send it to dspace-devel as well. maybe someone else will also have an idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: that was about 1182</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sorry, I wandered off for a sec, lots of distractions around here today, I'm more than happy to try my luck with RC3 release, though I'll need backup, as I clearly couldn't get RC2 out the door...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84, not sure I understand that answer about Ds-1182.  Why open it back up if the fix is in?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: it's in the comments. Joao wants to verify with one institution that it really works, so it's open just so that we don't lose track of it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I guess I don't understand when it gets "closed" then?  Why not just leave it "closed" and then verify with that institution that it works for them, and reopen if it doesn't work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I give up, close it if you want :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; This is why I Resolved it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sorry, I just thought maybe there was a good reason that I wasn't understanding :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: I know, but resolved is closed, we talked about it on the list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-green">* sands (~sandsfish@18.189.1.83) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Two names for the same state?  I thought they were separate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tim, will you have time to back up hardy tomorrow on RC3?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4718471/jira-to-close-or-to-resolve">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4718471/jira-to-close-or-to-resolve</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will be lurking on IRC tomorrow, yea.  Not sure I'd have time to actually cut the release though (which is what we had to do for RC2, as unfortunately it just wasn't working right in hardy's environment for whatever reason)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, hpottinger, I'll be around if you want to try again with RC3 :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: so I guess you were right to resolve it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger blames the user...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; i can be available tomorrow as back-up as well, or a second set of eyes at least.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; that'd be helpful sands... I may have limited time tomorrow, but I will be lurking most of the day</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; cool, maybe another RT member wants to have a try? It's fun!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* sands snorts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger stage whispers to sands "shhh, you!"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes that it sounds like helix84 &amp; mhwood have decided to "resolve" Ds-1182.   I just resolved it again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; any more button pressing to be done before RC3?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, I think we should press the button on pull #119: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/119">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/119</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Ds 1343 - Add parent pom.xml and build.propertiesfiles into the binary release by tdonohue · Pull Request #119 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/119">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/119</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This is a collaboration between robint &amp; I to fix the problems with the "binary" release of DSpace in both RC1 &amp; RC2.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've done a TON of testing with it today (including doing a "dry run" release) and I think it's ready to go</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It does change one minor thing about releases though.... the "mvn package -Pdistributions" command (to create the zip/tarball's for SourceForge) now must be run from [dspace-src]/dspace/ subdirectory.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I should note my boss is here in the room with me, and wants to talk non-dspace stuff, so I'm officially distracted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; thanks for all the extra testing tdonohue!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I wonder if we have a developer documentation where we could put your comment explaining that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- that "mvn package -Pdistributions" command should really only be run by someone doing a DSpace release...it's documented in our Release Procedure: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Release Procedure - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and I plan to update those Release Procedure docs with that minor change as soon as the button is pressed on #119)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hmm, I exclude components all the time to cut down on that damn maven build time. I hate that about Maven - there I said it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; who needs LNI and JSPUI anyway? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: oh, you are talking about the -P stuff (which is mentioned in the comments of #119 for those not following)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; oh, right, -Pdistributions is something else than -P with a webapp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, the other thing that changes with #119, is that you can no longer build just specific webapps by doing:  "mvn package -Pdspace-api,dspace-xmlui"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; However, you *CAN* exclude certain webapps from building by using "-P" with "!", like "mvn package -P!dspace-lni,!dspace-jspui" would build everything EXCEPT LNI &amp; JSPUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, to be honest..those "-P" things are for highly advanced DSpace Developers...as you may actually cause build errors to happen if you excluded *too much*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, there are interdependencies between stuff you wouldn't expect</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but maven is eager to point that out with some error or another</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not sure if this is really making much sense to everyone....  essentially the "-P" flag in Maven lets you turn "on/off" specific "profiles"....  robint &amp; I had to re-tweak some of our existing profiles to get the "binary" distribution of DSpace to actually work again...it's been broken since we added the "build.properties" stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; maybe we could put in that page that describes quick build vs. full build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- yea, we could add a note there about disabling specific modules from building by doing "-P!dspace-lni" and similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case...I think that Pull #119 is ready to go, unless anyone has any concerns.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; i think mdiggory was the first to craft and use those, so i'm not sure how he feels about all of this.  just pointing it out since he's not here to say anything one way or another.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sands -- he commented on #119 regarding that stuff.  I responded to his comment to let him know that you can still disable specific modules.  But, I haven't heard back.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; ah, k.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I can leave it open, if we want. But, I will note that until #119 is accepted (or we find an alternative solution), the *-release  zip/tarballs will have build errors (as they currently do for RC1 &amp; RC2)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'll reopen another topic if you don't mind. I'd like to get all the line endings fixed once and for all using gitattributes. tim had some concerns not to do it if there won't be testing after that, even if it's just whitespace change. so I think now's the perfect time - before the 2nd round of testathon. sounds good?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.  Got to do it sometime if it's to be done.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; this is what I'm talking about: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/65">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/65</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ EOL normalization with gitattributes by lyncodev · Pull Request #65 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/65">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/65</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I just have to note that it _might_ break some pull requests that are still open</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yea, I think it likely will break *most* pull requests that are still open.  As it likely will touch most files in GitHub (to update the line endings).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but there will always be open pull requests, now is supposed to be a low point for them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, that being said, I'd be OK with doing it before RC3...(though I'd suggest to wait until we get in any other "green-lighted" pulls first)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: my idea, exactly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; sounds like a reasonable time to me.  fixing the pull requests should be fairly simple (i think)...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; maybe they won't break - i haven't done it before :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, fixing the broken pulls will be relatively easy..but we'd just need to get each person who created a pull to update it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- looking at the number of files listed as being updated by Pull #65, I think some (if not all) will break at least in minor ways :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, again, I'm OK with that.  We just should warn folks whose pull requests actually do end up breaking</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it sounds like we're recommending Pull #119 and Pull #65 (though it'd need updating or just have a new pull created) for RC3.  Anything else, or any objections?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ask for a "quiet period" with no new pulls while old ones are cleared, so damage is minimized?  Not sure how long the moratorium would last -- would need to be quite short.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: would we also fix indentation? there's a lot of mixed tabs and spaces in the codebase.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; new pull requests should be fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i mean new pull requests opened after the change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; which should be done before tomorrow, since tomorrow is rc3</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: I'm hesitant to fix "indentation" issues until we come up with common indentation settings across all our IDEs.  I think the problem is being caused by our IDEs, to be honest.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I agree the indentation is annoying, but we likely need to figure out common IDE settings first, otherwise it will continue to happen)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 1.  Merge as many existing requests as possible.  No new requests please.  2. Merge EOL fixup.  3. Open for more requests, fix any that remained and broke.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I thought there was an agreement on style. The code style wiki page says whatever the Eclipse reformatting plugin does is canonical.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There's a specific packet of Eclipse indent rules for "DSpace style" as I recall.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- the Eclipse reformatting plugin *was* canonical when we were all using Eclipse.  Now that most folks seem to use IDEA &amp; NetBeans, it's hard to run an Eclipse plugin :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ok, so postpone until 4.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, all I'm saying is that we likely need to update those formatting rules to tell folks *how* to configure that in their IDE of choice (Eclipse, NetBeans, IDEA)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Got to have a massive whitespace reorg. or how would you know it's a .0 release? :-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; there goes another one...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I actually tried to use Eclipse with DSpace a while back, ran into trouble.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* helix84 draws his sawed-off shotgun</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DSpace + Eclipse = not fun :)  I used to use it, but it became more and more a pain (mostly cause Eclipse + Maven = not fun)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; Maven = not fun</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; right, I remember Maven and Eclipse cramping my style</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; maven/eclipse plugin had intractable problems, then they addressed this by removing most features and inviting people to put them back in over new code.  I moved to NB and never looked back.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think we should fix the EOLs right away (and they will stay fixed, as it's a .gitattributes setting)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, the matter of the fixing the tabulation may require some work, unless we find someone still running Eclipse + DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; When I reach for an IDE these days, it's usually IDEA, though I have to admit I'm mostly a Vim guy, still, and yay for IDE-agnostic EOL fixes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'm running grep and sed, so I could take care of at least the worst violations...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- what was your plan with grep/sed?  Just replace all tabs with 4-spaces?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: no, no. First detect mixed tabs and spaces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; frankly, Oracle not releasing their DB for Mac any more kind of took the wind out of my sails as far as developing with an IDE goes...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea. I agree, hpottinger.  I tend to be wary to "press the button" on my own stuff unless (a) it's a rather obvious fix, (b) someone else has "ok'd" it, or (c) it's at least sat there long enough to ensure no one has any major objections</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Though, even if (c) occurred later on, we obviously can "undo" any previously merged pull request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I added a comment to #119 letting everyone know I plan to merge it tomorrow.  We'll see if anyone pipes up with final objections</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; right, some rather big changes have been made with very little review in the past, and the project has survived...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep...the example of Graham's work is a good one.  We all basically gave him "free reign" for a good while in SVN when he was digging into performance issues...he was committing at will :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think folks have been a bit more tentative in GitHub, but there is not need to be quite so tentative.  If someone really disagrees with something that got merged, they'll let you know and ask for it to be unmerged (but most the time that doesn't happen, unless you broke something else on accident)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; was the most riveting series of messages to ever come across the -changes mail list...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; IMHO, of course, :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea...I remember trying to follow along on the -changes list with what Graham was doing...but there were some days I just said "heck, it's Graham, he's not gonna break something huge, and if he does we'll fix it"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; alright, I've gotta go, will be on #DSpace tomorrow, plan to start a dry run first thing, 9ish CDT</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I had rather bad feelings from the change that brought in build.properties, because it caused at least 3 serious breakages... I guess I should have backed it out then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, i'll be here (and make sure to press the button on #119 before then)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- anything specifically still remaining?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; no, not that i know of. remember that exponentially growing build directory?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; yay! and I like the build.properties change, I like that we have a community-blessed way of managing dev -&gt; staging -&gt; production</span><br />

I think they are mostly all squashed.... though, now I recall, I still may need to figure out a way to get build.properties to play better with IDEs (got pulled away from that for all the other POM stuff)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, overall, I also think the build.properties seems like a nice direction....despite the pain points</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I think I still fail to see the benefit, because you can define only _some_ changes there, but for others you still have to edit dspace.cfg...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; It didn't seem to improve my workflow in any way, so didn't start using it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the benefit in my eyes it actually could help make the build/install process be less "scary" to novice users.  You now just need to go edit some basic stuff in 'build.properties' rather than digging into the semi-scary dspace.cfg file to do a basic build &amp; install.  *AFTER* the install, you can worry about the endless array of options in dspace.cfg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, it also has the dual benefit of helping developers manage their dev environment settings separate from dspace.cfg (admittedly though, I think there still may need to be a few small tweaks to help it work better with IDEs though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so all you need to get DSpace up and running should be there?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- yea, I believe it all is.  The basic settings you need are all in build.properties.  Everything else you should be able to worry about later on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (though I'll admit, I'm not sure the build.properties idea really was thinking about simplifying the install process....but, I think it does do that, almost by accident)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so if we decided to move everything else into database to be configurabe at runtime, those things would still remain in build.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; (or just stripped dspace.cfg with those few options that are now in build.properties)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; possibly so.  Though admittedly, a few things in build.properties may also be able to be moved to the DB as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ack, look at the time. I need to head out of here, unfortunately.  Will be around on IRC tomorrow though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ok, I'll try to have the line endings ready before your day begins</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good.  I still do want to get in #119 just before the EOLs if possible though...not sure how that will all play out.  If needed, I guess I could quickly update #119.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; what to do about this ticket?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'm not sure. Do you think those XSDs exist somewhere?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; i've searched (not a lot, i admit) but i didn't found anything else</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; maybe the community could help</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and that tool Claudia found the validation errors with should have access to those schemas (at least locally), no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; yes, in order to have a successful validation those schemas must be available</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; locally or remotely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so I can write to openarchives.org and ask them to send me the XSDs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; yes, if they answer... that would help a lot</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; do you want to write or should I?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ah, yes, there were a lot of pulls during DevMtg today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; how do you link jira issues to github pulls?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; just URLs in comments :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the GitHub plugin for Jira is not very sophisticated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it knows about commits, but not about pulls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lyncode&gt; ok, nice</span><br />
