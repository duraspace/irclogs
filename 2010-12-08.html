<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Hi All, Tim Donohue is out of town today, so its me posing the first round of questions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; We'll discuss DSpace 1.7 issues:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; -- Any hot issues come up that need to be dealt with?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; -- Any defaults to change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; -- Sonatype</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; -- Getting the word out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-green">* sandsfish (~sandsfish@dhcp-18-111-27-8.dyn.mit.edu) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Firstly, my bad for missing the past few meetings (1.7, and git), completely forgot about time change, and another we had a staff meeting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i can't think of any "hot issues", though i have a couple of jira issues to finish off.. i keep getting distracted or asleep. i promise i'll get them done though! (DS-640, revert DIM xsl changes in SFX patch, and maybe something else i can't recall)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-640">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-640</a> -- Interal System Error when browsing with wrong argument</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep. all straight-forward, just gotta do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (although it's highly probable that XMLUI/cocoon won't throw the 404 correctly, at least we can make sure the dspace code is good)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (see <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-768">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-768</a> for more info on the cocoon 404 bug)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The other issues I've seen were memory related issues (permgen) on the demo box. I'm not aware of any known cause.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...but I haven't seen testers logging bugs in the recent while, no news is good news?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-green">* stuartlewis (~stuartlew@s-lewis.itss.auckland.ac.nz) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Also, I had a bit of an issue cutting RC2, as in it hasn't been done. So I'll re-work some things to cut an RC2, and a RC3, probably without announcing anything to the world, just to ensure the cutting process becomes smooth</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The issue was with dspace-api-lang version being null. So I'll revert some changes, and try to proceed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; PermGen usage is really down to sheer amount of code being loaded and/or intern-ed Strings. Not much you can do apart from cut down dependencies, cut down text, etc.... (some applications take far more PermGen than others)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; main heap usage is a different issue - no conclusive view of anything 'leaking' from tests, but because there is a finalize() method on the Context, there was an awful lot of memory staying resident in the cache when a Context is disposed (the cache couldn't be reclaimed until after the finalizer had been executed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; this has been changed, so everything that can be dereferenced (ie. the cache inside Context, plus others) as soon as possible (Context complete()/abort()). That makes it GCable, before the finalize method has been called (for which there are no guarantees of execution)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; this has reduced the pressure on the heap by about 25% - that is, 25% of the allocated heap is available to be garbage collected sooner, and not tied to finalization. Obviously, it still depends on when the GC actually happens</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ... long pause ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; - Any defaults to change?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was thinking to change the default theme in xmlui to mirage, but I don't see any way to justify an arbitrary decision like that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; (especially without a proper theme design contest / competition)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, lets get some experience in the field first and then phase it in?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Yes, we should be sure that Mirage is as debugged as the default.  Maybe it's the default in 1.7.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i would be even more conservative</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; if it were using dri2xhtml with better css, then I'd change the default without much worry. But it uses a new dri2xhtml-alt, which is less tried out than dri2xhtml.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; and say 1.8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; there are some CSS issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; and a few other form issues, besides the ones i logged (and ben fixed) so far</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* PeterDietz eats his words, as kshepherd brings up CSS issues in Mirage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; benbosman++ # been very prompt and diligent at fixing discovery and mirage bugs i log</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it's a nice theme, for sure, but might just want to let people testing out important stuff like submission and workflow in real environments for a few more months before deciding it's 100% stable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; s/testing/test/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So I guess the answer to "any defaults to change" is "not yet?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ok, works for me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; mdiggory is not around, so discussing sonatype would be mostly irrelevant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; how's doco looking, generally?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i think solr statistics should be pretty well-described now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; one of the interesting things involved is creating a 4096bit key, which required introducing entropy into the OS, the only thing that worked was to play a video game for a few minutes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I get so much UCE, I hardly ever run out of entropy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I now jtrimble is barreling through the docs, he's mostly been emailing me about formating ideas. Things like simplifying the markup when people create doc pages.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;  /s/now/know/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I would like to have some "opionated installers" though, such as the best way to install DSpace is run as user tomcat6, edit server.xml, ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd is full of opinions ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; No, leave server.xml alone; write Context fragments in $CATALINA_BASE/Cocoon/localhost or wherever.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ohh, I think part 2 of being opinionated, is to then write it down, neatly formatted, in a place that others will find it useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So is there a designated place to write it down?  Plenty of opinions here too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeah, <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/Configuration">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/Configuration</a> is great, but we were told it wasn't for "work-in-progress" or draft doco</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; would be cool to have a similiar area for compiling some best practices</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; mmmm... other than adding cookbooks, recipes, or other. I would almost think to add a note to <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/Installation">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/Installation</a> to say "See the community maintained best practices here: <a href="http://....",">http://....",</a> followed by some standard dspace installation notes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I tried to work over the install doco but it got reverted -- I was making it too abstract or something.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (if i have anything to write, i'll just stick it in my user page on the wiki until others have approvd it for the DSDOC doco, or another area on the wiki)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; there was dspace-tech mail today saying DSpace is too darned hard to install for a linux n00b such as myself. I think that guy could benefit from a good enough installation guide that is simpler.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; surely an opinionated installer is one that asks you where you want to install to, then says "well I wouldn't if I were you"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...then to break into a tangential topic such as internet censorship and wikileaks?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Many are the times I would have settled for one of those, as long as it did what I told it in the end.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; identifying common scenarios and writing really easy "step by step" guides for newbies is a good thing, but first we have to make sure we do understand the scenario(s)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, for sites that don't customize the Java, it really *is* too complex.  Can't we get it down to (1) unpack tarball somewhere; (2) edit 3-4 lines of bootstrap config file; (3) point servlet container at it; (4) use admin. UI to complete configuration and enable users.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; and those who are planning to edit Java have someone that knows java, who will be able to figure out the basics of being sysadmin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mhwood: +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hmmm, the folk who understand Java *and* sysadmin. seem to be rare.  I would say that their incidence in DSpace land is much higher than average.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Whee, I just destroyed my own argument.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; good point though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; controversial hypothesis: the more you simplify the install, the more complaints you'll get that you can't just modify *everything* through the web interface. Discuss</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; possible..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Aside from those 3-4 bootstrap lines, I think this is a valid position.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i would really like to do a survey and see who many people rebuild with custom java (ie. actually need maven)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; s/who/how/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; As soon as all the bits can find each other, the software should be functional.  It may not be doing what you want, but you can use it to tailor itself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I wouldn't advocate an obfuscated process, but I think there is a natural balance in making it easy enough for people to get started, without expecting it to be entirely flexible as an 'install and forget' app</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OTOH there are those 3-4 lines of bootstrap config.  I don't think you'll be rid of those ever.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; opinionated opinion: dspace-tech's "help me" traffic would drop by at least 10% if we had an install/config UI that warned people when necessary environment conditions (eg. permissions on [dspace], tomcat character encoding, existence of cronjobs)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; ....weren't met</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; some of that stuff would be hard to make generic for all OS's though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; cron should probably be left as "advanced configuration", for example.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But we may be able to do a better job distinguishing "no access to that because DSpace was told not to let you have it" and "no access to that because the OS won't let DSpace use it".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; (end of the hour)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'd like to give the repository manager the ability to config their DSpace without buggering their sysadmin to do input-form updates at first, then also get the rest of the configs in there as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so it sounds like the precursor to a dspace 1.8 wishlist item</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I would say 1.7 will be shipped out the door in a little over a week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yay, then I can start feeding in things that missed the feature cutoff.  (Nothing major at the moment, but stuff that shouldn't go in so close to release.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The getting the word out note is that me / @mire will be working on a webcast to highlight the changes in 1.7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Great!  Do you need anything from the rest of us?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; We'll approach the release with light announcements on release time, saying its been released get it while its hot. Then a few weeks later we can talk about institutions that have had smooth transitions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; auckland.ac.nz plans to be an early adopter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The final tidbit that I've recently been married, and my wife and I are expecting a baby in June. Which we're hoping to name Onepointseven, which is a nice unisex name.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;  /s/we're/I alone am/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; Just for the record, as this is being recorded (for customer training purposes), congratulations and best wishes from all of us :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; PeterDietz: congrats though, that's awesome news :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, congratulations to all of you.</span><br />
