<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b you might want to ping Dylan Meeus on that issue. It does sound like a POM related problem though...likely wrong version in [dspace]/lib/ (which is what is used by commandline scripts)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK, not hearing any other questions/comments on OR16.

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I don't anticipate any further large-scale changes, but during the meeting obviously we'll have a chance to move things around or add more topics, time permitting)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think that's all I have for OR16.  Though I will leave this topic with a teaser... Find me at OR16 for "limited edition" DSpace T-shirts.  Committers / Steering / DCAT will get priority though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Moving along now to 6.0.  Ideally, I'd *really* like to get 6.0-RC2 released this week (so we can announce at OR16..and helix84 can talk to it during his 6.0 intro talk)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The only thing (I'm aware of) that is standing directly in our way for an RC2 is DSPR#1382 (and we were just working on that in #dspace prior to this meeting).  IS there anything else I'm forgetting that *must* be in an RC2?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1382">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1382</a> ] - [DS-3179] Collection admin, edit item no authorization to remove file by KevinVdV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (There are plenty of other minor, known issues which we'll still want to squash between RC2 and Final... but I'd like to get *major* issues fixed by RC2, if possible)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; We have found a number of AIP issues.  I presume those just wait for final.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: yes, those are high priority for final, but I don't think they are absolutely necessary for an RC2.  Especially since everyone is swamped right now prepping for OR16</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; So, the purpose of an RC2 is to create a more stable demo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Though, just realized it'd be *nice* to get DSPR#1370 and related DSPR#1350 merged.  Both just need testing, as combined these fix issues with PubMed integration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1370">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1370</a> ] - DS-3144 Update of publication-lookup config by jonas-atmire</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: exactly. Plus, we've had a *ton* of changes since RC1, and I'd like to get those tested.  Without a new release, we don't have a good opportunity to test on what we've fixed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; Makes sense to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, having some known issues in RC2 is not a big deal overall. But, we do want to ensure those get squashed too before final.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, all that being said... I think the main (serious) issue standing in the way is still DSPR#1382 (which is a serious bug, as deletions don't work for Community/Collection Admins)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Should we spend more time on that now? Or is there any other topics that our small trio would like to touch on first?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm looking for where I goofed when merging with master, as previously discussed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hearing no other topics. So, I guess we should dive back into 1382, and see if we can solve this quickly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I was working on a "re-merged" branch (manually correcting merge conflicts in 1382)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think I found the mistake, around line 628 in ItemServiceImpl.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ha!  Commented out that line and:  BUILD SUCCESS.  ITDSpaceAIP passes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; excellent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; care to push that up to your branch then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Working on that now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Pushed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue Note to All: I suspect the rest of this meeting will be simply triaging 1382.  Others are welcome to either stick around and listen/help, or head off to do other tasks.  Next week there will only be a face-to-face Meeting at OR16 (no IRC meeting)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood. I'll pull that down, install and test</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I'll be lurking here and investigating the commons-lang3 issue I referenced</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maybe we should have an issue to take up lang3 everywhere and ditch commons-lang?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; sorry, I had late shift today and had to care about a library visitor that was not feeling well. So I missed the meeting.

<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: not really. I think we need to solve our outstanding issue, then hopefully get RC2 released tomorrow or Friday (if we are lucky)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I'll be here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It sounds like you have had enough to do already today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; mhwood, I do not know enough about the difference in versions to make a recommendation.  I am currently puzzled at how the 2 differing versions of -lang3 are getting integrated.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; mhwood: yes, it was intense today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I presume they are pulled in by other dependencies.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Two versions of lang3?  Ugh.  'mvn dependency:analyze' and 'mvn dependency:tree' help with these.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; thanks.  I will try that... I am a niave mvn user and did not know about those commands</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; 'bye everyone, see you tomorrow and hopefully at OR16!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The output is voluminous.  You'll want to capture it and rummage with your favorite browsing tool.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; Some good news.  I populated my test DSpace 6 instance with 500,000 items and the database performed well.  We matched the memory that we have in production in order to run the test.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; YAY! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Very good news.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: you should make sure to let helix84 know at OR16.  He's doing the "intro to 6.0" talk, and that'd be a good tidbit to mention regarding how the "API Refactor" is performing, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: and thanks for running and reporting on those tests</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; A huge improvement over my prior tests.  Either the code got a lot more efficient or my test server was really inadequate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; (on the past yest)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DSPR#1326 included lots and lots of refactoring for speed/efficiency.  The fix named in the title almost disappears....</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: while your branch passes tests, I'm still getting errors when I try to delete Bitstreams as a Community Admin.  I get: "Authorization denied for action WRITE on BITSTREAM:[uuid] by user [uuid]".  It's from the BitstreamServiceImpl.update() in the BitstreamServiceImpl.delete() method.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thanks, I'll have a look at it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds almost like our new ON DELETE CASCADE has cleaned up auth policies early :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Why does delete() call update() anyways...that's a bit odd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Because Bitstream is odd:  delete() marks it deleted in the database.  We actually destroy it later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, that's right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Huh. This code is messed up...the actual deletion in "expunge()" also checks Resource Policies...but those are cleared out in "delete()"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; delete() shouldn't be removing Resource Policies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This really needs a Unit Test. It doesn't look right to me, but it'd be hard to fix without one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There's a test for delete() but nothing for expunge() (which should throw errors)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Woops.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I highly doubt expunge() works as written</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Do you still have some time this week to work on this, mhwood? I kinda feel like we are narrowing in on issues... but I think we need more Unit Tests here, as I suspect we have a few (hopefully minor) flaws in methods that don't have unit tests yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I will find some time.  I'll have to go in a few minutes, today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, suspected as much. I'll be around tomorrow (meetings first thing, but might be able to make some time midday)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; You're welcome.  We need to have this working.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I wrote myself a note about what's happening, and I have an installed instance to play with, but I've got to leave.  'bye all!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bye!</span><br />
