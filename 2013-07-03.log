<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt;  The main question I wanted to pose (to anyone who is around), is whether there were any last minute suggestions/comments to our OR13 Developer Meeting agenda.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kstamatis&gt; Hi everyone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kstamatis&gt; Hi Bram</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yea, I wasn't wanting to *add* to the OR13 agenda.  More just wanting to see if anyone had any tweaks/feedback on it.  Just wanting to get some verification that it looks good.  I agree though that it's already a pretty full agenda</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and for anyone who isn't able to attend OR13, we'll obviously have a notetaker &amp; post notes publicly to that wiki page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; One area where we have no modularity is with the launcher configuration.  Adding on a command means editing the config.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Sounds like no last objections / tweaks to the OR13 agenda, so I think it's pretty well "finalized".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Obviously the other thing to note:  There will be no IRC Meeting next week because of OR13, obviously.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Next topic:  4.0 (which we'll also discuss a bit at OR13)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Regarding 4.0, I mostly just wanted to let everyone know that I've heard from Andrea Bollini, and he has volunteered to help on the 4.0 Release Team (joining mhwood &amp; hpottinger).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Obviously we'll need to start to nail down 4.0 possible features / deadlines.  I'm hoping we'll get a better grasp on possible features during the discussions at OR13.  We'll obviously want to also turn around and set some deadlines/timelines very soon (as for 3.0 our first deadline came up in late Aug)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, I need to devote more time to coordinating.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, I'd be glad to sit down with you &amp; hpottinger &amp; abollini at some point at OR13 (since we'll all be there), if it makes sense.  We can always see what comes out of the Monday OR13 Dev mtg and draft some timelines/deadlines out of that, perhaps</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Beyond those two (small) topics.  I really didn't have anything else to discuss today.  :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; I'm gathering internal input from our folks to see what we can already announce at OR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; but personally, I'm pretty committed to seeing the translationwiki stuff succeed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if anyone else has topics they want to bring up, please feel free.  Or we can end the meeting early or do a few PR reviews (or similar).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bram-atmire: good to hear. Yea, would be good to have an idea of what @mire may or may not be "targeting" for 4.0.  Would love to see the translationwiki stuff moving forward too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; does anyone of you have any php experience?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; the translationwiki stuff is currently stuck at a point where a small connector needs to be extended</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; for translationwiki to understand the cocoon msg format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; it's in php</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not I, sorry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and the translationwiki people already did a first attempt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kstamatis&gt; me neither</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; but they asked us to verify &amp; finish it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; ok, tough luck ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm pretty sure some of the SWORD folks know PHP well.... The "EasyDeposit" app is PHP I think.  That'd be stuartlewis (now an "emertitus committer" though), possibly richardjones.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I have PHP experience the same way I have experience with influenza, but I have encountered it once or twice.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I vaguely have memories that kshepherd may have also done something with PHP...but maybe I'm wrong there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd imagine one of us should be able to "pick up" PHP though (at least enough to finish writing that small connector), if needed.  It cannot be *that* hard ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I could take a look at it, but really I'm not the person I would go to for PHP if there was anyone else.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; verified EasyDeposit is PHP.  We could beg stuartlewis (who wrote it) to write us some code ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Anyone who's worked inside Drupal or the PKP products (OJS, OCS, OMP...) has experience with PHP.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; ok tnx</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; could always just ask on dspace-devel or dspace-commit if we got folks who know PHP.  I'm pretty sure we do... just a matter of finding someone with some time to chip in and help</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other topics you three want to discuss today?  Small attendance obviously, and I don't want to keep you all here if you have "things to do" ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, I see.  you can now use IPs or hostname or useragent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, there are separate lists for each.</span><br />
