<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My feeling is that we should include this in the RoadMap as part of our goal to have *one* primary stats engine (Solr Stats).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I feel like the legacy reports have been "legacy" for a while, but users depend on them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I presume disabling functionality in a 6.x release would not be advised</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, in fact, I already updated the RoadMap (see 7.0 Priority 1 table, #3 row) to link to terry-b's ticket: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/RoadMap#RoadMap-CandidateFeaturesforDSpace7.0-Priority1">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/RoadMap#RoadMap-CandidateFeaturesforDSpace7.0-Priority1</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: yes, we don't remove features in minor releases. So, we're "stuck" with this for 6.0, but can remove/replace it for 7.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; There are a handful of additional action we will want to track (logins, oai requests, item archives).  If we then have a rich reporting interface in REST, we should be good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I also see that aschweer already added some comments to the ticket on features that these Legacy Stats have that are not (yet) in Solr Stats. So, it'd also be good to add those into Solr Stats</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; There were some side comments about migrating from SOLR, as the primary record but I presume that is not the roadmap</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; We could even extend the event logging to have a complete “audit” trail: Who edited which item and when.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; That would be useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I will create a ticket for the new transactions we want to track</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I guess the main discussion question here is:  Does anyone feel we should *not* be moving to remove these Legacy Stats?  If there's really no controversy here, then basically we just need a volunteer to start moving this forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; My concern with only storing statistics in SOLR has two reasons. One: SOLR is not meant to be used a data store, only as a search index (see Peter Dietz comment in the mailing list). Two: Making a consistent backup of DSpace (including SOLR stats) is now not trivial.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The current situation is confusing.  We should sort it all out.  I'm less sure that we ought to just shovel everything into Solr .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm perfectly OK with rebuilding Solr stats to be only an Index. That's a *separate* task to me though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First, I just want to solve the issue of having 3 Stats engines under "simultaneous support" (Elasticsearch, Solr and Legacy)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; How should we track the question of whether solr should be master?  Would that need to fall later in the roadmap, or would that need to happen in 7.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; A.  We should be capturing the raw cases that we need.  B.  We should provide consistent statistical products that meet common needs.  C.  We should not stand in the way of folks who want raw cases to do statistics that we haven't thought of.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: "whether solr should be master"?  Not sure I understand that statement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; re ES stats, DS-3287 has an update</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; D.  We should not confuse people with overlapping reports by different methods.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3287">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3287</a> ] - [DS-3287] ElasticSearch fails (does not work at all) - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; The master copy of the stats records or just a secondary index</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, I see now, terry-b. Sorry, I always think of "master" as GitHub master branch ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; The work on removing the “legacy stats reports” will have to wait untill the REST UI in mature enough. However, making the database master of the stats (and using SOLR only to index and efficiently query those stats) can already start.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; My brain is trying to tell me we've had this discussion before</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I remember the discussion but not a resolution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-2525 is related to this (I'm searching JIRA right now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2525">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2525</a> ] - [DS-2525] Separate &amp;quot;access log&amp;quot; for usage event data - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-3450 is related (somewhat)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3450">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3450</a> ] - [DS-3450] Record OAI, SWORD, REST calls in SOLR stats - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm updating this tickets as "Statistics" component</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; I’m not sure if it is a good idea to only log usage events to a (separate) log file as that would not simplify the DSpace backup process.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; *these*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How not?  Flat files are easy to back up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; But not if they are constantly changing. You could catch an unfinished write operation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; (That’s the difficulty you have with SOLR now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK.  The storage mechanism is less interesting than getting the cases out where serious ad-hoc analysis can be done, if people want to do that.  Also uncluttering the general operational logs is interesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We don't have to figure this all out now. But, we should create a ticket to update Solr Stats to be an *index* of [something] (DB, flat file or something else)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; Agreed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Solr can perhaps contain finished products, indexing them to make slicing easy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm pretty sure log file issues have been well resolved by others, it's a pretty common pattern (common enough that log analysis tools exist for this use case)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; What do other repository systems do for stats?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; hpottinger, I was thinking the same thing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; google analytics &amp; stuff things in log files</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DO other systems do stat.s built-in?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm pretty sure a lot of others don't have stats built in. They assume you will use Google Analytics (or something like it), or just point a third-party log parser at your access logs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; The advantage of DSpace could be that we could take this much further that just “view” stats.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I worry that DSpace will wind up as 20% repository code, 80% statistical do-it-all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; if we had a URL that reflected the hiearchy of the repository, we could easily just use the apache logs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, to be fair, it could be we still depend on Google Analytics (and the like) for flashy "view info stats", and tailor our "built-in" stats engine for stuff that is highly DSpace specific (e.g. Admin stats, etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As an example, Google Analytics cannot track "how many new items were deposited this month/year/forever?"  But, DSpace could do that much easier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; We have a very full plate for 7.0.  How much do we want to take on?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, let's get a volunteer to create a JIRA ticket about making Solr stats an index (instead of a storage area).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I will create a ticket.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 2525 is kind of already that ticket?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Kind of.  Because we will need *some* new storage for cases.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How we store them accessibly and reliably is discussable.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: to clarify, we are not promising this for DSpace 7.  Our RoadMap is very specifically ordered.  This is #3 on our list.  #1 is massive (new UI), and if we only get that done, then everything else will be rescheduled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; maybe just re-write the summary/description for 2525</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it's "nice to have" for DSpace 7. If someone wants to "run with it", then we may be able to make it happen.  Otherwise, we aren't guaranteeing it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; mhwood, it is your ticket.  Are you OK with a new description?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; in the process of working on 7, we might get it "for free"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, I reckon so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The same thing, but more abstractly?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think so, pull out the specifics, maybe capture them in a comment instead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not sure 2525 is the same as "Solr Stats needs to be an index"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; When create the REST API methods for DSpace 7, we can log some “extra” events in the same effort.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sure.  I'd just like to have less clutter and more accessibility of raw data.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm not sure Solr Stats needs to be an index ;-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If the word "index" is making people nervous, how about "cache"?  That's what Solr is for.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right...Solr is a cache/synthesis of raw data coming from somewhere else</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; and SOLR can contain more data (e.g. metadata of the item related to the usage event) than de definitive copy (only the timestamp, user agent and other request info).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, sounds like we are done with this discussion</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: does this relate in any way to the open PR around Sharding?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I encountered it while testing that issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; The sharding succeeds... all seems ok until you restart tomcat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; tom_desair, I wonder if you can recreate this issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; wait... this is a specific data situation that results in a failure to boot, not a general "if you shard your stats, tomcat won't boot" issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; hpottinger, why do you say that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I am saying that if you shard in DSpace 6, this problem appears to happen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; I’ll try to reproduce the issue and see if I can fix it. My PR is pretty useless if it breaks Tomcat restarts.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: why does your Sharding process include those 1-3 steps where you are pasting in a different record &amp; saving?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Hmm... I can't duplicate this. I have sharded stats with DSpace 6, and my repository is still running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If you simply run "stats-util -s" on DSpace 6, does this still occur?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; hpottinger, Have you restarted tomcat?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I have</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; Hmm, I have one other user who saw the behavior: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dspace-tech/oKf7M6FoaLY">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/dspace-tech/oKf7M6FoaLY</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; Unfortunately, the sharding is very difficult to re-test, so I have to follow my contrived example to reproduce the issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; true, ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; I wish I had backed up my solr directories...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; But it is a test box</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It sounds like this needs more testers. We need to see if others can reproduce this as reliably as terry-b...and if so or if not that may give us more clues (hopefully)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; I’ll test with differnent stats cores to try to reproduce the issue consistently.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks tom_desair!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; tom_desair, thank you!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; FYI, I have another meeting at the top of the hour</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so another ticket to mention (briefly). Committers, I still need a volunteer for DS-3431 (currently access restricted to Committers)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other tickets folks want to bring up here, in the last 15 mins?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; I have a (junior) developer working on the collection sorting. We should be able to deliver that next week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks tom_desair!  And thanks for all the recent work you (and your team) have been doing to help track down bug fixes, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; DS-3287 has a rather definitive update</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tom_desair&gt; You can see it as a New Year's resolution ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I already moved that back to "needs volunteer", hpottinger.  So, yes, we need more help there in just getting it "basically working" again (for now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will mention again, I've been slowly trying to help chip away at the JIRA backlog (when I find a free 1/2 hour or so).  I see Bram is doing the same these days.  If others find time during the week, I'd again recommend helping out!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Part of my New Year's resolution is to try and get a "handle" on JIRA &amp; PRs.... So far there's just so much of a backlog, that I haven't made much more than a dent...but that's where I'll be concentrating efforts in coming weeks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I made this filter: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2349?filter=13907">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2349?filter=13907</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: I cannot see that filter it seems (you might need to share it).  All I see is that single ticket</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; bah, one moment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b&gt; tdonohue, that is a good resolution.  My motivation to contribute is dampened when PR's and tickets languish</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; try again</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: now I see it. Wow, that's a long query ;)  But, thanks. Yes, those are all our unresolved tickets for unsupported versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Some of those likely need to just have "affectedVersions" updated...others though might be closeable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: just realized your query is slightly wrong.  It's 3.x and below that are "unsupported" (you included 4.x in there)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; revised it</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; correction, revised it again, 204 issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, in any case, sounds like we have nothing else to discuss today.</span><br />
