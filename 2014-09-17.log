<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Again, we'll kick off with the usual reminders...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 1) Our 5.0 Feature PR deadline is rapidly approaching!  Just about 2 weeks, on October 6.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 2) If we have anyone who would like to jump onto the 5.0 Release Team, there are still spots available...I know they'll need our help more and more in the coming weeks anyhow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; please?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Basically, 5.0 is starting to "take final shape" in the coming weeks here.  If you have anything still outstanding, be sure to get a PR created soon and/or talk with the 5.0 RT (and us) about what is still coming</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Can I join?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; join? you're leading! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in any case, the rest of today's meeting is set aside to talk about 5.0 Features (especially any with PRs already)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or any other 5.0 related topics/questions you may have</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, yes, can *I* joint the RT, too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; s/joint/join/g</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; hpottinger meant to say: oh, yes, can *I* join the RT, too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; That makes 4 on the team now - Peter, Peter, Hardy, and Hardy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; nice! we've got a great team shaping up now!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; excellent, and we also have all the former RCs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But each is only half-time.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, all kidding aside, I figured it'd be good to revisit DS-1582 / DSPR#629 today, as it has the potential to affect other PRs coming in the pipeline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/629">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/629</a> ] - Support Metadata On All DSpaceObjects by KevinVdV</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, the first question is, has anyone been able to pull away some time to do a review/test?  Looks like mhwood did add some minor code comments to the PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And I actually just noticed that KevinVdV asked that we not merge the PR quite yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; He's addressed all of my noise about isOracle() too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; nice.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Yeah the pull request requires a rebase &amp; the unit test for oai were still failing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; But it is good to test</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll admit, this is still on my "todo" to give it a test run (by trying to upgrade an existing DB to one with Metadata on all)...but I haven't gotten to it yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Likewise, just struggling to find testing time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone else out there able to help try and give this a look in the next few days/week?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Has anybody else tested it yet ? Because I really would like some other people confirming it doesn’t break anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hm, actually there are still three instances of db.name.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm guessing that silence = nobody has tested it yet.... which means we really need testers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yea, I see those too...there's still three instances that need to change to DatabaseManager.isOracle()</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Indeed but these changes I left because I didn’t alter those calls.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Don’t want to invalidate the pull request from mwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ah, I see, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm trying to think how to actually test this properly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; The metadata for all ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well the best way to setup a simple test instance, add some communities, collections, items, ....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; &amp; migrate the data with the pull request &amp; test the dspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My idea for testing would be: (1) Take an copy of an existing DB, (2) Pull down the PR#629, (3) Upgrade/Migrate the existing DB, (4) Rebuild with PR in place....(5) Redeploy and test that everything still seems to work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's that "everything" that worries me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But, basically just a smoke test.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; A good start would be to check the current metadata</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; IS everything still there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Next create a new community/collection/item/bitstream/group/eperson</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yea...a smoke test...browse around, make sure the data is there. Try editing a few things, try creating a new Item, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; &amp; see if that still works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; basically make sure nothing *obvious* breaks.  It'll get an even more thorough test during Testathon, but we want to ensure that it doesn't massively break the codebase all over</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; if you're so moved to actually script those tests...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I would *love* it if we could script such tests ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I’m afraid nobody can guarantee that EVERYTHING is bugfree, but that is what a Testathon is for</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I will try to clear some time within a week to spin up a patched instance and try it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; KevinVdv: agreed, this should just be a sanity check</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; VagrantDSpace spins up PRs pretty quickly, and can populate itself from a pile of AIPs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll try to do the same...although I still have several tasks on my plate before this one that I need to try and get through quickly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-green">* hamslaai1 (~hilton@197.79.73.255) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; REST-API has a nice machine-readable interface...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger is sure he can goad *someone* into writing a better smoke test...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If we can find a few other folks to help give it a test run, that'd be great.  Another option here would be to spin up a central test (perhaps even on demo.dspace.org if there's enough memory) which we can all bang on a bit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, we have at least a few folks stepping forward, so hopefully we can get this reviewed/tested sooner rather than later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and if I can get to it, I might see if demo.dspace.org has enough space for a test version up there to bang on...we'll see)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Agreed, all feedback is welcome</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Are there any other 5.0 PRs to discuss today?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I will be finishing the pull request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks KevinVdV...definitely let us know when the final PR is up too...even though the existing should be testable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, another thing to note in general... We are still having Travis CI issues (not sure if anyone has noticed much)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; They popped back in place with DS-2133</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: How are you initiating the Maven build? I mean, what Maven profiles?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; From what I can tell, TravisCI doesn't like our final "assembly" (where the 'dspace' module actually creates the 'dspace-installer' directory)....

<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: yes, looking at the PR, bit slow off the mark today :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it's two steps...(1) "mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=false" (which Always works..our Unit tests always succeed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Followed by (2) "mvn package -Dmirage2.on=true -Dmirage2.deps.included=false" (from [src]/dspace/).... (This is what randomly fails on the building of /target/dspace-installer/)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've tried a million different options to try and encourage Travis along. But, I'm starting to suspect that we may not be able to run the full "assembly" (of /target/dspace-installer) on Travis CI...instead, we can just do Unit Tests and individual module assemblies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I wonder if there is a problem with m-assembly-p itself, perhaps addressed by a newer version.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we're on the latest version of m-assembly-p.  Tried that too :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I *haven't* tried reverting to older versions of m-assembly-p.  But, yes, the problem here is EITHER m-assembly-p itself, OR m-assembly-p just uses a lot of memory/CPU when packing up 11 separate modules (which is what we have)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; do you have a link for the fail message?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: here's an example of a failed build...it just shows a "Killed" message after 'dspace-installer': <a href="https://travis-ci.org/DSpace/DSpace/builds/35161660#L6400">https://travis-ci.org/DSpace/DSpace/builds/35161660#L6400</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Even if Travis CI will do a "retry" after that failed build....all the retries will also fail with "Killed" messages (at other random points)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; According to TravisCI docs...that "Killed" message means you are exceeding the bounds of their memory (3GB): <a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#My-build-script-is-killed-without-any-error">http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#My-build-script-is-killed-without-any-error</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The initial "Killed" message *always* occurs on the "dspace-installer" build step.  Any additional ones just occur randomly elsewhere.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/648">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/648</a> ] - More Travis CI build fixes related to DS-2133 by tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; So it is just coincidence that it is the Mirage2 build then? We were already sailing close to the wind in terms of memory?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: yes, I think it's coincidence that it started with Mirage2.  I think Mirage2 was just "one more module to package up", and became the straw that broke the camels back.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've since tried disabling the Mirage2 build, and it still happens even without Mirage 2 being built/compiled. So, I'm 80-90% certain that it's just related to m-assembly-p and our building of 'dspace-installer'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, none of this is very easy to "test/debug" in Travis CI...so there's always the chance I've overlooked something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I just ran du -sh . in my working copy, it weighs in at 3.5GB</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it's not 3GB of space....it's 3GB of memory (to do the build/test)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; According to TravisCI docs if your build/test exceeds 3GB of memory, it will just be "Killed".  But I'm not sure if there's other ways to see that same "Killed" message, or if it *always* means you've exceeded 3GB of memory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Any other alternative CI sites out there?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; None that are free and integrate as awesomely with GitHub :)   Honestly, I love Travis CI for its GitHub integration, but we definitely seem to be breaking the bounds of it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, if anyone else comes up with something, I'm honestly all ears.  Until then, I may end up going as far as *disabling* the final "dspace-installer" step, and simply running Unit Tests &amp; individual module builds in Travis CI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; For testing purposes could we try dropping some modules eg LNI, to see if it then builds?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I realise this is dependent on finding time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, we could disable some modules from building ("-P !dspace-lni" does that)...and see what happens</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; we can shrink DSpace. Major refactoring in these last few weeks, Remove everything except for dspace-api, dspace-services, and dspace-rest. Kick out the UI's, and refactor OAI/sword to live within one of the other modules.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; haha...Good luck with that ;)   In all seriousness though, I do suspect longer term we may wish to avoid our massive proliferation of modules... It'd be nice to start to merge some.  As a basic example even, could dspace-api/dspace-services/dspace-rest just become ONE modules (which builds a JAR and a WAR for REST)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There may be some situations where separate modules are warranted...but the concept of "lets just throw in a new module" may need to be rethought if we want to be able to keep our build/test process more reasonable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; We could drop one of the UI's!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; notice: robint is joking, do not be alarmed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maven does not like producing more than one artifact per project.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I wonder if we might be able to ask the Travis folks for help?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; they seem to want to be helpful for open source tools</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, I'll keep tinkering around (when I find time), to see if I can find a way to fix Travis issues.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; maybe we can get special dispensation to let our builds cross the line?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; because we're just really friendly folks?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: yea, I probably should put in a ticket to see if they can give more feedback on what "Killed" means.  But, I doubt we'll get special dispensation, as I've seen other tickets where their response was "sorry, our limit is 3GB...you seem to be going over that"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, I'll log a ticket with them to see what they say. Just need to spin up another breaking build or two as good examples.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I wonder if we capped Maven's memory at, say, 3GB if Maven could "figure it out?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've tried setting MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx1024M ... and even 2GB...doesn't seem to matter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; that's odd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I need to run, until next time !</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Assembly doesn't fork a separate process, does it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It's unclear though whether m-assembly-p obeys those memory limits or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: dunno.  I *do* know that m-surefire-p forks a separate process (and therefore ignores MAVEN_OPTS)...but I don't know about m-assembly-p</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; looks like you can specify memory usage for tests</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: yep, but tests aren't the problem. They always succeed. Memory failure happens on m-assembly-p step.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Likewise I had to specifically allocate extra memory for the Javavdoc step</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; It didn't care about MAVEN_OPTS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case...we're nearly out of time here.  I just wanted to let you all know that Travis CI is still having issues with our build. I'll still tinker with it a bit, and likely also reach out to Travis staff too.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Until then, the only thing I can recommend is to "restart" a build if you see a "Killed" message on your PRs.  Sometimes you need to rerun it 2-3 times before it'll finally succeed.</span><br />
