<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure, sands.  Are you having an issue with it?  Perhaps ask on dspace-devel or dspace-tech?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; my colleague is deploying 1.8.2 with Shib and is having a difficult time determining if the Apache config for shib is correct or if it is causing some weird behavior.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As with the last few weeks, I figured we'd bypass JIRA reviews so that we can concentrate on the 3.0 Release (and maybe even call some votes on some of these outstanding features / pull requests)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First though, just wanted to again publicize the new 3.0 Schedule: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+3.0+Notes#DSpaceRelease3.0Notes-TimelineandProcessing">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+3.0+Notes#DSpaceRelease3.0Notes-TimelineandProcessing</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Does anyone have any comments on that new schedule?  (will pause for a brief moment)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mdiggory (~mdiggory@rrcs-74-87-47-114.west.biz.rr.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; happy to see postponed the freeze deadline of 1 week (and also added more details about what this mean - pull request in github)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep.  Also to be clear, the RT decided to "rename" the "freeze" to be a "contribution deadline"...not really a "freeze" anymore...just the deadline to getting your stuff into a pull request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; yes, very useful naming change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Hello everyone.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Sounds like no more comments on the 3.0 Schedule, so we'll move along for now.  If there are suggestions for more changes to the schedule, please email dspace-devel/-release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; do we think this push-out will be sufficient, or more time still needed (we can still deliver in 2012 with further push)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes the Release Team is more than welcome to chime in on questions :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I just want to correct in my last email, I did mistake that the contrib deadline was set to next friday, not this friday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so strike my point (1) to push it our further ATM.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; richardrodgers:  I think the schedule is always a bit of a guess and is even more so this time around with our move to GitHub Pull Requests.   But, we do still have flexibility in the Schedule.  We've only ever announced that 3.0 will be out "sometime in Oct/Nov".  Currently we've pushed back to Oct 26</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Just out of interest, does anyone present have any contributions still without a pull request ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; tdonohue: fair point, but my concern was with potential submitters, as robint is just asking….</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; tdonohue, +1  it is not hard and fast</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue / richardrodgers That would seem to leave some room for consideration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, a minor rewrite of LDAP auth</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; SOLR DAO (I will make a pull request probably tomorrow), Pubmed and Statistics (not sure to be able to contribute with the current deadline)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and also DS-1193</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1193">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1193</a> ] - [#DS-1193] display bitstream read access permissions on item page - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; @Mire --&gt; Statistics,  Configurable Workflow and Item Level Versioning contribs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Quite a lot then, on the positive side its going to be great release !</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it sounds like we still do have quite a few pull requests that are still coming :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood was hoping for some dspace-devel discussion of harmonizing Pubmed, Total-Impact etc. altmetrics work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yep, everyone is on a crunch :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; robint: that's the spirit!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 robint -- may shape up to be one of the biggest releases in terms of features</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Taking a quick look at our local customizations, and see if there are any other goodies worth pushing upstream. We've got things like facebook opengraph metadata, rss feed improvements for itunes (U), and a curation task to get the duration of audio bitstream.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok.  So, that all being said, it sounded like (via email discussions) that we wanted to call several *votes* today on some of the outstanding pull requests</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: that was my worry addressed in the proposal, its clear that there are a great deal of motivated parties involved with contributing to the release,  the more significant issue is getting the review process to be efficient enough to get things process and moving forward.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Shall I go ahead an call those votes? (I know of votes requested on @mire pull requests and on XOAI...I can call them one by one, if we are ready)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: yes, I will like to work with other on these topics but I will need that my colleague come back from holiday to be more reactive (27th August, so just after feature submission deadline)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'd like to call a vote on putting XOAI into 3.0 (hitting the merge button). Of course, if there are any comments, there is still time to address them before release, this is just about getting this feature in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think its important to clarify what the nature of the vote is initially.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'll start with my own +1 to XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; +1 to XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; +1 to XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mdiggory shuts up and gets started</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; +1 to XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1 XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; +1 to XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; +1 XOAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to XOAI being accepted to 3.0  (note the language here -- I think we may need to call a second vote as to whether it *Replaces* OAI-1.0 completely)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So what I wanted to get clarity on is that we are voting to accept a pull request for a feature.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That was my understanding.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK.  XOAI final vote:  +9 to accept for 3.0.  No votes against.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: well noted as I think the pul request may replace the existing dspace-oai module ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; if i understand things correctly, the OAI 1.0 module is completely decoupled, so I would be +1 for releasing it separately.  (if we're going to vote on that.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; If I may be so bold to call the second vote of XOAI replacing OAI (the current pull request has this form). There is still the option of releasing the old oai separately,they can be even stalled side-by-side, but this vote isn't about that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; robint: likewise... This pull request cannot be automatically merged.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; helix84: still some conflict blocking auotmatically merging it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I think that we should try to move ahead! replace oai 1.0 and if problem or other arise we can decide to release a oai 1.0 update after the 3.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; but it looks like something happened in master that makes these unable to auto-magically merge in. Mine broke too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; contributions happened.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: I see. I'll see to that it gets addressed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PLEASE VOTE:  Would you agree to XOAI completely replacing OAI-1.0 in 3.0?  This would mean that the old "oai" module would be entirely removed from "master/trunk".   (As mentioned, we could move it to a different project if folks still wanted to use it instead of XOAI.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; after reviewing a number of the smaller requests from others that were not significant in nature (bug fixes and minor api changes) that could be accepted, those PR were accepted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes +1</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Might be best to decide what we do with old OAI before merging</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; XOAI uses the original OAI code for its default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: i'mnot sure what you mean but i don't think you're right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; +1 to replacing, as long as the original OAI module is made easily accessible for those who still want to run it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Ok perhaps I misunderstood lyncode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 replace, as long as it's documented</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; +1 to replacing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: noted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; but wasn't there an iteration where the old oai code was added and the default was to use it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; +1 to replacing. Is it default to running via DB or via solr?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; To clarify -- XOAI does NOT use the original OAI-1.0 code.   However, XOAI can be configured to use DB queries like OAI-1.0 (By default XOAI uses Solr though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; +1 to sands point - since OAI can be locally extended, we don't want to strand people</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: default is solr, DB means changing a single option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; does it use those db queries in its default configuration?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we should talk about SOLR as default in general...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to replacing -- agree with sands (OAI-1.0 needs to be made still accessible for folks wanting it) and hpottinger (XOAI needs to be documented)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  Looks like the vote for XOAI to replace OAI-1.0 is : +9 in favor.  None opposed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (However, we need to be sure to move current OAI-1.0 to a separate project for folks that need it, and XOAI needs documentation)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; please note that imho SOLR/DB default, where put the old OAI module etc. are questions that come after hit the merge button</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: how can OAI be provided and replaced at the same time?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; OAI 1.0 that is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: might be easiest to do that before the merge of the new one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so, to explain what OAI 2.0 is: it's written from scratch. OAI 2.0 is the DSpace data provider which uses the XOAI library (external maved dependency, bsd-licensed, developed by lyncode) to do the heavy lifting (similiar to the way the old oai webapp used OAIcat)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- move to code to a new 'dspace-oai-1.0' GitHub project *before* it gets replaced</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; s/maved/maven/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; helix84 meant to say: so, to explain what OAI 2.0 is: it's written from scratch. OAI 2.0 is the DSpace data provider which uses the XOAI library (external maven dependency, bsd-licensed, developed by lyncode) to do the heavy lifting (similiar to the way the old oai webapp used OAIcat)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, we have 3 actions coming out of this vote:  (1) Someone needs to move current OAI-1.0 code to a new GitHub project (for folks who need it), (2) XOAI pull request gets committed (replacing OAI-1.0), and (3) XOAI needs to be documented.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; some questions may arise as to if we want to see that library be in the dspace codebase or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84 has the start for a wiki page right there. ;-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; to clarify, I'm asking do we want to see DSpace OAI be dependent on an external XOAI library, or should the external OAI library be contributed to the codebase as well, so that it can be maintained in unison.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; this isn't about accessability in Maven Central</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; This is about dependency on externally managed code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; mdiggory: good question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mdiggory: I think that this is not a decision that we can take. It is owned by Lyncode</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; note: we didn't control OAICat, either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Some of the Greek code is also based on jars they maintain</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OAI-1.0 already depended on externally managed code -- OAICat by OCLC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; for instance, we accepted dspace-services originally with dependencies on some librarye that aaron maintained and released, but felt that over time, this wasn't best because we could not maintain those ourselves and correct them directly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it's BSD licensed, so we could fork it. Not that I have any reason to recomend it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I think it is reasonable to consider the context of any jar we choose to depend on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; clarification: there's no reason to fork the code, but it's an option if the need arises in future.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I agree with helix84. Just use it now as is, in future we will decide</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think it is definitely worth discussing any JAR we choose to depend on.  I'm just pointing out that both XOAI and OAI-1.0 depended on externally managed dependencies.   Ideally though, I agree that we'd hopefully want to manage such code ourselves when it makes sense to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; spoiler alert: i'm going to call a vote on accepting lyncode as a commiter soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Is there some specific reason to suppose that XOAI will fall into disrepair or evolve away from what we need?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; Q:  the OAI module is in the 1.8.x branch.  We can grab it and manage it somewhere, or point people to that branch, yes?  Lots of other discussion to happen before the end of the meeting, what with XOAI being accepted already...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; could lyncode be interested in move their library under the duraspace hat?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; to be clear this isn't a judgement on lyncode or helix84, this is about assuring that DSpace depends either on stable, available, well maintained libraries and that if we want to develop the XOAI further, we are not bound to getting approval from a third party to make those changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: on the contrary, it's in lyncode's direct interest to keep it working great with dspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; because the code is under the ownership of tha third party</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; this is a dialog about copyright</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: actively maintained: check; bsd-licensed = no approval: check</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I personally think XOAI has a better chance of "not falling into disrepair" than OAICat, just because of the fact that XOAI source code is published on GitHub (&amp; can be forked at will).   Though I do think it's worth asking Lyncode if he'd want to submit it all to DuraSpace &amp; get the benefits of broader community support.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The elastic search code is good as-is. There is some idea, that I'd like to make it easier to test by adding a import-stats-data-to-ES launcher</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I only want to verify if it impacts any of the existing statistics api</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: would that importer be in 3.0? 3.1?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; we run elastic search in production, no problems to report</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Is there a stats-importer for folks wanting to upgrade/switch from Solr?  Or do you have to start your stats fresh?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Thus far, I've only built a dspace.log -&gt; ElasticSearch tool.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; uncommitted</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: I notice updates in StatisticsTransformer, do these impact the existing Solr Stats behavior at all?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I initially wanted to make this an add-on module, but ran into several difficult questions if it would be a module</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. I'd suggest we likely need some form of importer (minimally from dspace.log).   Otherwise, it seems like it'd only be useful for new DSpace installs (or folks willing to toss out their existing stats)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; it only enhances StatsTransformer. adds a new constructor to pass in your date limit (start, end)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'd prefer to keep a common interface / services for statistics for DSpace with common log processing, but with different backends and views</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...and some additional growth-statistics data (DB driven), that go with the stats view</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I agree with making a stats interface. I started that work, but you make tons of bad trade-offs forcing the data to fit into a new container.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; good question from bollini... I think the UI improvements (screenshots) are AWESOME :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ES data is not the same as SOLR response data</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mmm... I have a general concern about reusing the JSON output directly form a search engine as is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, sounds like folks needing to leave here...so, we may just have to leave it at that.  It seems like most folks still have questions about Pull #63.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I want to suggest to introduce a common JSON object that we can fill with data from different search engine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; BTW SOLR can produce JSON (it is used by the XMLUI autocomplete feature)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: solr already has json as an output format, just the contents is probably not what the same. The question is if the solr response has everything you need.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; mmm. I doubt that the response of ES and the response of SOLR would be identical.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; in the JSON porting we have simply serialized in JSON the DSpace Discovery "model" (FacetValue)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: I think we should continue a dialog with KevinVdV and assure that we identify features being brought to the table in the stats contrib and look for alignment.  Yes Solr can both produce json and we can customize Solr to produce different outputs if neccessary.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: likely not in format, byt what about the data?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; sorry s/JSON porting/JSPUI porting/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; you still didn't answer my question PeterDietz is the data stored in a similar format in ES?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory +1  -- I like the idea of continuing this discussion with KevinVdV to see if there's better alignment with Solr Stats possible</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; meaning 1 ES record = 1 DSpace event</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; With better "alignment" between the two statistics backends (Solr or ES), I think this would make a good feature.  I just worry right now that the current ES work is almost a new stats system -- I think we need them to stay aligned</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The schema / mapping is very similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Or, the other option is to make this a separate module altogether, if there is no way to keep them "aligned")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; i.e. lat/long, type, id, time, I started from solr.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was thinking I didn't want to build a concrete interface that wraps ES and SOLR data, when I could still be evolving the output of ES</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; by "alignment", I also mean aligned behind the same UI.   That's the area I worry about.  It could get hard to support two different stats UIs in all of the various XMLUI Themes, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: good, thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I still think that we should try to introduce abstraction also in the format sent to the browser (JSON not tired to a search engine but derived from a DSpace "model").</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes this is just my initial opinion -- I'm willing to be swayed/overruled &amp; I fully admit that I haven't had a chance to do a thorough review of everything in the ES work yet.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; this looks very similar to the work that we have done for the HKU and that we initially plan to contribute for 3.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So, different queries can respond with different output. The trouble of forcing this to go through some type of clearinghouse (abstract model), is that creating a new query probably means creating another method in your model</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I think that we could have a chance to review this work and make some alignments (JSPUI/XMLUI SOLR/ES) after the 27th August</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- but if all you're doing is pulling out JSON (from ES or Solr), couldn't their just be a generic JSON which most query results could go into?

<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Right...if ES &amp; Solr could be setup to export a common JSON structure, it could be used to then drive the cool UI stuff (like you've already done with your work)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I am unaware of anyone working on dspace SOLR stats, so its an extra step to make this change also touch SOLR in the same move as contributing ES</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I would guess that anything engine1 can do, so can engine2, its just a matter of if you want to get around to implementing it. So you could implement a query such as visitor's from *.edu hostnames in Elastic Search, then add a data-graphic to your view.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- KevinVdV &amp; mdiggory are good contacts on the SOLR stats part.  As mdiggory said earlier, you could work with them to see if there's a way to align the ES stuff with Solr stuff (and that way you only need to do the ES part of it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; peter, my thinking here is: is this similiar enough to the (JSON) results format Solr already provides so that it can be shared? Solr response format is mature and well-defined, so I'd suggest to adopt it if you can. OTOH, if your intermediate formats are still developing, which is a good thing, maybe it's just not ready to be distributed in DSpace (again, not necessarily a bad thing, because it gives you freedom to break stuff to make it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; better). This is all just my thinking out loud, not saying that I'm in any way opposed to anything about ES.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; If someone comes along and also implements that for SOLR, then great, it shouldn't hold up the show.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and peter, i know how it feels to work on something and want to push it upstream to a wide audience, but the consequence of that is that you'll have to keep it stable (or proveide an upgradepath) once it adopts users</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I renew my offer to take a look for JSPUI/SOLR, but not starting before 27th August (this is in conflict with current deadline)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; It would be nice to see if the interested parties for supporting Solr-based stats could collaborate with PeterDietz and align the interface improvements, if the only way to get the shiny is to go with ES-based stats, I know how my users will want me to vote. :-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- from my understanding with Solr, you're only going to get out as "pretty" of data as you put in.  So, that data my only look gross cause it wasn't really indexed initially in a "human understandable" way.  It could be a matter of just reindexing the data in a different way to get a different looking output</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Also, one fundamental difference between solr and ES, is that for each facet in Solr, you have to make another query, which gives its response in json.

<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; yep. Sorry the ES show/tell isn't going smooth.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm not sure what my take-away action is, that can be done before the cut-off. Work with Kevin to determine a common data format for SOLR and ES to share.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm confident that we can get the same response starting from data read from SOLR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Right -- PeterDietz.  I'm not arguing for or against ES vs. Solr.  As far as I can tell, they are actually both quite similar.  All I'm pointing out is that the "ugly" Solr output you are seeing is happening because of how DSpace is *indexing* things in Solr.  So, we can always change how we index the data in Solr to get a better output.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; please note that I have say "data read" from SOLR and NOT the same response from SOLR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was thinking for output, you were talking about html, css, chart libraries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: no, the standard json format from SOLR is different than the ES format (shown by Peter). It is not related to the stored data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: this is why I'm asking to define a dspace format (that eventually can start from the current ES format) and support it for the future</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: I think the next step is to chat with Kevin &amp; perhaps bring discussions to the dspace-release/dspace-devel list.  You can always ask for an "extension".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we are not tired to the JSON SOLR response to supply JSON data to the browser... we can query SOLR, manipulate the response and build a JSON response</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Ahh, okay good. Since ES and SOLR both natively output their data into some serialized form of JSON, but they're different formats.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; unfortunately I need to head out now...will catch up more later.  bollini, if you have suggestions on ways to get Solr to support better JSON, definitely feel free to let us all know (email is probably best at this point) -- If we can find ways to get this all merged in better it'd be great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So, maybe there is a DSpaceStatsJSON object, and I do DSpaceStatsJSON.parseES(es_response), and also DSpaceStatsJSON.parseSOLR(solr_response)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; our API should only return the DSpaceStats object, serialization can be provided by an utility class (common to JSPUI, XMLUI, SOLR and ES implementation)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was at this point a couple of months ago, thinking of the DSpaceStats common object, I can't visualize it very well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; so the browser layer (javascript) only need to know about the structure of the DSpaceStats object (as JSON object)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; sorry to have used DSpaceStats, I mean a *new* object that we have to define</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; right, some new not-yet-existing class to be the common object</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I think that we can start using the actual format returned by ES, I want only be sure that our API define a return object with a know structure and not a "string" where the contract about structure is keep on the UI layer (javascript)i</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; are you working on a porting of the discovery search stuff to ES?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Our librarians don't want to use discovery, so solr-discovery is unpopulated on production. Thus we haven't pushed towards moving that to ES</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So.. facets are complicated. I think that is the type of data we want returned by statistics.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The alternative to a facet is raw data. Which would only be useful if you want to display the raw data of the last 10 visits to this collection</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So one question about doing this the proper way, and using the DSpaceStats interface. What does that gain us, when say we migrate to using MongoDB-Stats, and we have to modify the dspace-stats objects structure again to fit the new provider, which might do data differently</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; no we need to think about the structure that we need to provide the features that the users ask for</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; for your new UI improvements we need an object with two properties? a name and a count, just define it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; to the ES / SOLR / MongoDB providers will be asked to fill this object to support "current" features</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; a question: ES response format is only JSON? or there is a "javabin" format?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; in your implementation the browser access to ES or the JSON ES response is streamed to the browser by a "proxy" servlet/trasformer?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; browser does not get the raw response. ES runs at localhost:9200, so DSpace will perform the query, and get a response object back. And pull off a piece of that response, and hide it as a hidden element in the html.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I could have gone the route of proxying it. But I don't like the idea of the browser making direct calls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hmm. I'm guessing that ES only outputs JSON...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; agree. I'm against direct call from the browser</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; It has its own response processor you could use within java against that response object (if you wanted to do all manipulation from Java)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; TermsFacet countryFacet = resp.getFacets().facet(TermsFacet.class, "top_countries");</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; addTermFacetToTable(countryFacet, division, "Country", "Top Country Views (all time)");</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; exactly, I think that you should return a new dspacestat java object build using the "java" response from ES, so that we do the same using SOLR and the differences between the JSON format will be not more important</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; next, the new dspacestat java object can be serialized in JSON for make the life of the browser layer easier using some external library</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ok sorry, i didn't check the flexjson, and now i see its a Java thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; if I have understand your architecture now you have XMLUI code - call ES -&gt; get JSON -&gt; embbed JSON in HTML response -&gt; jquery get the json from the html and parse i</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I propose to change in</span><br />
