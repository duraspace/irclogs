<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; argh, it's our lone perl script</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The fix itself seems right.  I rambled on about all the other things that need fixed in it, but this one is good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Do folks use this script?  I'm fine with this PR, as long as folks use it.  But, if no one really uses 'dspace-info.pl', I'd question whether we should even be shipping it with DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: no worries, thanks to mhwood, we already started piece-meal work on replacing it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I think we should keep it before we have a replacement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; if for nothing else, then for inspiration what the replacement should do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's already got one vote.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; btw this is a fix, so i really should have merged it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, well, then go ahead and merge in the fix. It seems obvious enough.   My only question was whether we should even have this script around (but I agree, it seems useful in some ways, so we might as well keep until we can replace it)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it still doesn't have full functionality (getting attributes) and I think there are 2 implementations</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I should give this some more attention, as we would *like* to be using CAS.  (I even have Yet Another Implementation to deal with the hacked CAS at IU.)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; oh, sorry, I was still talking about CAS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I remember looking at 188, thinking it seemed reasonable, but unsure whether I'm a good enough judge of XSL-T to speak up.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We'll stop there for today anyhow.  That was the last PR for today.  So, I can pause here a moment, if there's confusion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, today is essentially and "open meeting" anyways.  The only other topic I had on the agenda was to talk about 4.0 planning.  But, if there are more pressing things to discuss, please feel free to let me know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Regarding 4.0, I mostly wanted to encourage us to think more about timelines &amp; put out another call for folks interested in joining the Release Team.

<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; scrolling back, I see we talked a bit about the dspace-info.pl script. I had a nutty idea about that the other day, what if we replaced it with a Groovy script?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; why not jython?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Why not REST?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; my point being, either we go java all the way or we go back to accepting any language</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84++  I'd rather we stick with Java since everything else is Java right now.   REST is an option though, as would be even a shell script  (though maybe not as easy to implement)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Jython, Groovy, doesn't matter to me really, and "any language" is a far cry from "including some jar files so we can write a simple script and still use our configuration system"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not against doing things in other languages though -- we just haven't "standardized" on anything else besides Java.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; It looks like good fodder for a /site REST endpoint to me</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; could port most of it to mhwood's DS-552 servlet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Groovy / Jython both run on a JVM though, so, I guess either isn't that far of a stretch anyhow.  They are both closer than "perl"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; remember we have a "Who uses DSpace" section at dspace.org?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; people submit that information manually (dspace version, interface, which features they use), which is a pain in the nect both for us and the dspace.org maintainer</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; my suggestion was that we could provide an option upon DSpace installation (or even at any time) to send this information to dspace.org</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; for that, we need to gather it, first</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Or how about just letting people register base URLs and the site can sample them from time to time?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yep, that was the idea. give users the option to expose this information about their repository.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, hpottinger. you had to pull that out :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. hpottinger: you have my blessing to rewrite that script in Groovy :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; on my list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; does that mean gmaven-plugin already pulls groovy?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not sure that Groovy actually gets installed into DSpace.   But, gmaven-plugin work is an example of a place where we (I) used Groovy during our build process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maven probably ought to have a more general plugin for dealing with local path syntax issues.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; it's a good point of clarification, helix84, I was merely pointing out that we've already crossed the "only Java" line, not that we're set to use Groovy scripts.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Meanwhile, I think part of the problem with the existing script is that it does too much and doesn't ask enough of things (running DSpace, running DBMS) that already understand what they are doing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'll take advantage of this multilanguage-open atmosphere to inquire - would you be fine if I contributed some stuff I made in Jython to DSpace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case though, I agree with the general "thread" of this discussion to look towards making this info available via a UI (or even REST)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: just let me point out that it can't be just one of the UIs - what UI is used is one of the important things being reported</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; RE: Groovy v. Jython v. JRuby v. whatever.   I'd rather we try and "standardize" on a particular dynamic language for this sorta stuff.   Ideally, we wouldn't be doing much in any of these languages though (unless we built an entirely new UI based in one of them), and seek instead to make more of this info available from the UI.  A common complaint is that too much in DSpace is still commandline only.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; "Which UI(s) used" is difficult.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: yea, sorry. Didn't mean "a UI" meaning *one* UI.  Just meant that these stats are useful to surface in the UI, if we can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'm generally in favour of using JVM based scripting languages, but agree with tdonohue that we want to avoid a proliferation of languages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; You'd have to ask the container, and know how to recognize what you are looking for.  And be *able* to ask the container.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to JVM based scripting languages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: since you mentioned it, developing a new UI in jython was one of my wilder ideas</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I will suggest more plainly that if we have to script it, we may not be thinking about the problem properly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It is a question that should always be asked.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood is probably on to something, though novel solutions are sometimes found by people "not thinking properly"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i was thinking more along the way that scripting gives you a rapid way to iterate, because the build-deploy-restart cycle of DSpace is simply way too long</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Depends on how many hundred JARs you have to drag in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Whats the intent of knowing someone's UI? Knowing how popular that UI is? If you want the content, you can probably get access to their OAI, or perhaps some future rest-bulk-extract endpoint, or just their URL to homepage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so it lets you develop quickly some things that can be *eventualy* replaced by pure java. the question then is if we do allow any (JVM-based) scripting language in the DSpace source we're distributing or only pure Java?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; scripting is a nice fit for reporting, especially in the use case of "my repo manager wants to know these stats, to keep our library director happy"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I want to allow any language UI. (So long as it know how to consume the DSpace REST API)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, if we're scripting for prototyping, that's different.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: the "Who's using DSpace" page is actually immensely popular. It lets you filter by version, UI and features, so you can look at different existing repositories when you're deciding whether you want DSpace or a new feature in DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; hpottinger:  consider where is the optimum partition between the report generator and the thing reported on.  A tiny script that yanks out some XML or JSON seems right to me.  The gathering of the raw info. belongs to the thing reported on, I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz:  Folks use that "Who's using Dspace" page to also find examples of DSpace sites they want to replicate.  As we have multiple UIs, it's important to them to also understand who is using which UI.  We also do want to have an understanding though of how popular a UI is overall</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: on the other hand, what if it's not prototyping? would you allow, e.g. a Django UI?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood: as long as the barrier to generating the info needed is low enough, that works, but when you're in a shop full of script-writing librarians...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't think I'm in a position to allow or forbid.  I would suggest that we already ship stuff "in the box" that maybe should migrate to add-on status.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; RE: new UIs. I think it's fair game to build a new UI in *any* language.  I'd be all for a new UI being built.  However, just because it's built, does NOT necessarily mean it becomes "out of the box" (or default)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Currently, as (nearly) everything is Java, we are "standardizing" on that (and perhaps some stuff that can run on JVM).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I would also urge that whether it goes in the box should present very little barrier to a thing being built. If it's cool enough, you'll build it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; However, if in the future, there was an amazing Ruby on Rails (or whatever) UI built, that we felt should be the "Default UI", then we can change our minds at any time.  None of these decisions are forever</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I hope we can agree to say what's fine and what isn't - because allowing one JVM scripting language while not allowing another just feels wrong to me. So I hope we can say let's just have pure Java or let's have any of them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The one thing I will push back on though.  We cannot continue to "add another UI".  Ideally, at some point, we need to standardize on a *single* out-of-the-box UI.  There can still be third-party-supported UIs out there...but, it's too much to ask the Committers to support/sync many UIs at once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; tdonohue++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; N-1 UIs is one of the things I would "plug out" of DSpace, so long as we didn't lose them altogether.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We don't even have to ship the coolest UI in-the-box.  We just need one that works well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: I think what is "acceptable" is still up for grabs.  Admittedly, my comments on Groovy were a bit "tongue in cheek".  Ideally, we "standardize" on Java &amp; one JVM-based scripting language (TBD) though... keeping us at one scripting language just makes it easier to maintain.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Sorry to potentially change topic. But does anyone have any insight on kicking robots out of your statistics?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we need a UI that is easy to extend... the most cool plugin are probably related to UI features</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; googlebot, fastsearch, yandex, ask, shorty...soton.ac.uk, scoutjetm, ask, discoveryengine to name a few are in our statistics data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think curation scripts are a special case, pretty much "anything goes" for that use case, if you prefer a different scripting language, use it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I need to get back to robot exclusion.  I'm supposed to be working on by-agent exclusion.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; to clarify one of the things i'm offering here in jython - the UI was only for the sake of discussion and it's clear that we don't want UI proliferation - but I can add a new kind of importer which I can pretty much guarantee would be quite popular. I'm not saying it's not possible to do it in Java, only I can't do it and I already have it working in Jython.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; "our statistics data" could mean Solr, ES, or something else...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger ++  Yes, to be clear, you are more than welcome to create curation scripts (or even add-on modules) using different scripting languages.  But, the "out-of-the-box" DSpace should try and simplify to one main scripting language</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: as bollini says, please do share your jython scripts.   The only problematic part is what the "Committers as a whole" can maintain.  But, hopefully we can find other "subsets" of developers who are willing to help maintain scripts in other languages.  So, one could imagine a "dspace-jython-tools" modules (or a better name) which could be maintained by 4-5 folks (who may or may not be central Committers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We should have an organized "contrib section" for stuff that's broadly useful but for some reason is thought not to belong "in the box".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; dspace-contrib</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd love to have a "contrib" section somewhere.  Just haven't been able to figure out how best to set that up / manage it.  Open to ideas though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we could just create a "dspace-contrib" GitHub, if it's that simple. But, then someone would need to manage it &amp; dole out permissions or what have you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it could be a repo, but if we want to give write access to a wider group than just commiters, it would have to live under a different GitHub organization than DSpace, because the contrib commiters need to be members of the owning GitHub organization</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm confused by "contrib", We're talking about the bazaar of plugins/features/themes/UI's right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so, something like <a href="http://github.org/DSpace-contrib/DSpace-contrib">http://github.org/DSpace-contrib/DSpace-contrib</a> would work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; "contrib" stuff can be developed anywhere.  It's not part of boxed-DSpace development (no matter who develops it).  But there should be a place to *publish* the results of development, where people can look for cool stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ok, I vote to keep the bazaar out of the cathedral. Build a "codex", a webapp / registry for people to publish their wares</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; a wiki page doesn't work very well, as you can see here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Repository+of+XMLUI+themes">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Repository+of+XMLUI+themes</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we need something that can be easily pulled as a whole, but with lower barriers to entry</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; that's why we're talking about a complementary repo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we don't have staffing/developers to build or maintain a "codex", as nice as that'd be.  We need something simple &amp; relatively low barrier to entry</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Or a volunteer.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, anything we did would have to be simple... relatively easy to maintain (otherwise it could get outdated quickly), and relatively low barrier to entry</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Aaaand, I have to go.  Will check the log later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; what do you mean by codex? I know Wordpress codex, which is a developer's documentation, but it seem that's not what you mean.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think a lower-barrier repository, community-driven, would probably work fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (mwood@mhw.ulib.iupui.edu) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; GitHub does seem like a decent candidate...but then we'd need to just determine who is the "gatekeeper" to let things in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; there are Wordpress plugins for tracking github repositories</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: PeterDietz was the one who called it a "codex" = "a webapp / registry for people to publish their wares"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; how's that different from a free-to-register wiki?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I said codex, in terms of a code-exchange. You can advertise your plugins, modules, plugins, UIs. WordpressCodex is more of a wiki. They have some other thing that lists whats available 3rd party</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so, like mozilla addons?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; surely there communities have solved this same problem?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; s/there/there are/g</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; hpottinger meant to say: surely there are communities have solved this same problem?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There's the idea of the addon "marketplace", e.g. Atlassian <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/</a>    But, I have no idea what they are using to power it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Browse, Try, and Buy Add-ons for Atlassian Software | Atlassian Marketplace ] - <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; various other sites have similar "marketplaces" where you can download (or buy) addons to [insert software name].   Not sure that there's an easy way to do set that up though  (would love to find out if it's out there)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; yep. I'd say goals are to connect 3rd party features to someone looking to extend their platform. Offer some type of information / documentation / support / Download-and-install-plugin functionality. So yes, an AppStore / Play Store for DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The keys here are:  DuraSpace doesn't have the staff (or funding) do build or maintain something like this ourselves.  So, we'd really need to either outsource or buy something (or find an open source product to install).  IF nothing is easily available, we'd have to go with something that can just "get the job done" (e.g. GitHub)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; app store _sounds_ like it would offer only addons that don't require you to rebuild dspace. there are plenty of existing addons that require you to build dspace with them. just trying to clarify what we are addressing here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: ideally, it's an "appstore".  But, short term, you are right.  Currently DSpace doesn't deal so well with all types of "addons".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm thinking we'd be holding both source code (themes, etc.) and artifacts (curation scripts, maybe other things?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the difference between wordpress (which offers plugins) and dspace is that you don't need to recompile wordpress</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, while the long term "dream" might be a DSpace AppStore.  The short-term reality is that DSpace may need something in the interim...it's not like Wordpress in terms of plugins</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: themes, aspects, curation scripts and addons that can be deployed as a separate webapp are not a problem. what about things that depend on changes to core dspace (i.e. rebuilding dspace)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, would GitLab be a start? (<a href="http://gitlab.org/)">http://gitlab.org/)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; AFAIK, gitlab is just a local GitHub</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; would it give us anything that GitHub doesn't?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; GitHub doesn't like to store built things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Does GitLab handle "built things" differently somehow then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i have a hard time finding gitlab documentation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; GitHub can and does store built objects (I'm looking at *you* Isalndora) but I don't think the GitHub folk like it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; You can upload a file to your "downloads" in github. I wouldn't recommend an alternative DVCS system. By all means, 3rd PArty DSpace developers should have a github repo for their feature.

<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, hpottinger.  Git in general doesn't much like binary stuff (as it cannot 'diff' it as well as text/code -- and binary files therefore use more storage).  I'd suspect GitLab would be similar to GitHub.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I was mostly thinking in terms of "if GitHub won't do what we need, maybe something like GitHub, that we can hack/extend will work"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; What if DSpace actually defined a "Plugin" structure as being essentially a "zipped up" Maven project.  You could potentially point DSpace at a GitHub tag, have it unzip &amp; build/install via Maven.  (Crazy idea, I know)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, to bring this back around.  I think we all agree that we need something similar to this concept of a "codeshare" or "marketplace" for DSpace.  The key here is to find something we can reasonably support/maintain.  We could build a Ferrari but it'd take 5 years (and lots of money or dev time), or we can work towards something that meets the general needs now and build/learn from that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I obviously lean towards the latter.  We need to be "lean" as we don't have the $$ that Atlassian (and similar have).  GitHub seems like a great candidate for now.  But, I'm definitely open to other ideas/options if someone comes across something else that'd be nice to try</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I personally wish there was some sort of open source software out there that'd help us to set this sort of thing up :)  But, I'm not finding anything yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we might be approaching this from the wrong direction - we're looking for a tool, but we haven't said whether we want to put nails in or cut a branch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the one goal I think we'll all agree on is to have a central place to hold or link to all dspace addons/themes/aspects/servlets/scripts/modifications/webapps/tools</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the two problems I see are 1) hold or link 2) that's a pretty diverse bunch - we may need to treat each category differently</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ideally, in my mind...we'd *link* to where these things are available.  But, if that's too difficult, we could "hold" releases (though we would not maintain them).   I agree though the categories of what could be built is rather broad</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Essentially we're just trying to help people:  (1) Share their useful "stuff" &amp; find other useful "stuff" for DSpace, (2) Know where to go for maintenance/updates or questions (these things would not be maintained by the Committer Team, obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Longer term -- it might be nice to find a way to support a full "marketplace", similar to Atlassian or WordPress.  But, first we'd have to come up with a way to easily install "plugins" in DSpace without requiring a restart)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, I have to go here shortly as well.  Been a nice discussion. Just need to better determine where to start with this... I feel like we have several different visions here still</span><br />
