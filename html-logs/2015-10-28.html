<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Tim is unavailable today.  Who is running the meeting?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood: probably either you or me :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; yay, I was going to suggest exactly that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; there is no agenda on the wiki for today it seems, but I guess the main topic is 5.4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 5.4 and pending 6.0 deadlines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; in absence of other discussion, we can always keep working the 5.4 milestone "backlog" which is what we were just doing over the past hour</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; shall we start with 5.4? I'm happy to run that part but I'm not at all up to date on the status for 6.0, so someone else should take over for that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; ah sorry, I always forget about the backlog hour since I just can't make that time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I just marked all Jira issues with a PR with the 5.4 milestone as fix version = 5.4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; no worries, as I said, we can just pick that back up if we run out of things to talk about</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thanks for updating the issues.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; the other way round isn't synchronised up yet, as in, there are more tickets in Jira marked 5.4 than there are PRs marked 5.4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; with me having been away all last week, I'm a little behind. It looked like one big "maybe" for 5.4 is the solr one? DS-2823</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2823">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2823</a> ] - [DS-2823] Discovery doesn&amp;#39;t let you LIMIT the size of full text indexed, which can cause memory issues. - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; those of you who've been working on that one, can you give a quick update?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The PR was lingering due to discussion of exporting the magic limit number to a property (plus a default).  That isn't working out for some reason, but if we're happy with the simpler approach then I think it's about ready?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I guess the only question is, are we happy to go with the simple approach now even if it may change to the property approach later?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood's summary is correct, we have code that is "less magic" but there's no reason to hold it up for "more magic"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If it works and is beneficial with the simple constant then I would say do that now and worry about making it fancy later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; the only objection I can see is that people who _don't_ want this change will have to change the new default in one place for 5.4 and (probably) in a different place later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Point.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; but, I'm personally happy to have the simple approach in 5.4 given that good Discovery performance will be important for pretty much everyone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; If I understand correctly, the method of changing this default now would be compatible with the future way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: wouldn't you have to change schema.xml now but some properties file with the "magic" approach?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; also noting that for the default search operator the decision in the end was against trying any magic (I believe), but I guess that's something to be made consistent for 6.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; aschweer: any change to schema.xml would still get picked up, the suggested "more magic" would enable an alternate route to change the number</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: ah cool, I hadn't picked up on the default coming from schema.xml. So we're not asking people to change things twice then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm right :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; ok. So the summary for DS-2823 then is, if someone figures out the magic approach before 5.4 we go with that, otherwise fine to merge to 5_x as-is. Correct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2823">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2823</a> ] - [DS-2823] Discovery doesn&amp;#39;t let you LIMIT the size of full text indexed, which can cause memory issues. - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; correct, I clarified on DSPR1120 that my +1 still counts for the code as-is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Excellent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Another one for 5.4 that's a little tricky is DS-2542/DS-2524; if I remember right then one/both of these need a new version of xoai to be released (happy to be corrected on this one)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2542">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2542</a> ] - [DS-2542] XOAI does not support non granular YYYY-MM-DD harvesting properly - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2524">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2524</a> ] - [DS-2524] XOAI - from/until argument only works with date including the time - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's the way it looks to me as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So how do we get an XOAI 3.x update released?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; mhwood: I was just halfway through typing that same question :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Who can do the release? xoai is under the DSpace umbrella in github now, but is that enough for the maven magic?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; only one way to find out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: thanks for volunteering to try cutting the xoai release ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; har har har, I actually think that someone who knows what they are doing with Maven ought to handle the first release, I'm just a button presser</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; also, I'm leaving for a week's vacation this afternoon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; :) I agree, it would be great for someone who knows what they're doing to do the xoai release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So is the current 3.x in a release-able state?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How do we determine that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; the 3.x branch still has com.lyncode as the groupId</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/xoai/blob/3.x/pom.xml#L10">https://github.com/DSpace/xoai/blob/3.x/pom.xml#L10</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ xoai/pom.xml at 3.x · DSpace/xoai · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/xoai/blob/3.x/pom.xml#L10">https://github.com/DSpace/xoai/blob/3.x/pom.xml#L10</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So at a minimum we'll need a patch to fix that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; see? complicated, you don't want a noodle-head like me pressing that button :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I volunteer tim to do 3x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; any other 5.4 issues to look at?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I think it might be helpful for tdonohue to do this, yes. I'll e-mail him.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Looking further over the list of jira tickets marked 5.4, there is DS-2788 that doesn't have a PR yet - cwilper is working on it and says there may be an update soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2788">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2788</a> ] - [DS-2788] Performance degradation of SOLR Discovery indexing in DSpace 5 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; So I think that's it for looking over 5.4 -- obviously there are still a few things to iron out. But apart from that I guess it's down to setting a date for the release?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If it is 'dspace index-discovery' itself that bloats up and crashes then tweaking Solr is not going to help.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I think those are two separate things, agreed. Looks like for 2788 they're currently looking at the context objects, so not just solr tweaking.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; (just an aside, some solr tweaking might be a good idea too, eg the extracted fulltext is currently stored in 2-3 fields using the copy field mechanism IIRC)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh, yes, I'm sure we can do better in configuring and using Solr.  But in this case the problem seems to occur in a different process.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I admit I haven't looked at 2788 in too much detail, but I got the impression that it set out to address one thing and somewhat morphed into addressing a different one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-green">* starsun (~g@194.44.84.246) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I guess the question is, is 2788 serious enough that it would be worth delaying 5.4?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It does sound pretty bad for large sites.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-green">* starsun (~g@194.44.84.246) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; cwilper believed he would have something more definite perhaps today.  I think another day or three might not hurt, if there is a good chance of figuring this one out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I was thinking about Nov 4 or Nov 5 my time for the release (evening of Nov 3 or of Nov 4 in the US I believe), so there is a little bit more time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger wonders how many cwilper mentions we can work into this conversation?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maybe make a decision tomorrow or Monday?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Uh, forgot what day it is.  Thursday or Friday?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I can be available as backup on the 5th, I cannot on the 4th</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: hang on, what timezone are those dates?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; my morning is your evening the day before :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 04-Nov EST would be difficult for me, but I think I could be on IRC the evening of 03-Nov.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; (Next week we in .us will be coping with the end of DST on Sunday 01-Nov.  Extra vigilance is indicated.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I was figuring 20UTC-ish?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It is 20:46 UTC now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; ah right. if 20 UTC is good for people then it will have to be my Thursday, so 3 Nov 20 UTC (I have a meeting that time on my Wednesday)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; hpottinger: what was your backup availability?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'll be traveling 3 Nov and 4 Nov, 5 Nov I'll be working again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; (aka "Thursday")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; right. mhwood, what about you on Nov 5 EST?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can probably arrange to be available on 05-Nov.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Cool. Because I can do my Nov 6 easily and it gives us a couple extra days. And I guess "no releases on a Friday" doesn't really apply in this case anyway.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; So, tentatively scheduling 5.4 for 4 Nov 20 UTC ish, but I'll also check with Tim re xoai (since that has to come first)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Everyone, please feel encouraged to review PRs :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Now I'm confused again:  late 04-Nov UTC would be daytime 05-Nov in .nz?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; argh I grabbed the wrong day. Tentatively scheduling 5.4 for _5_ Nov 20 UTC ish</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; sorry about that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I better make sure to have more coffee before the release than I've had today!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I have a note on my calendar for 05-Nov-2015 2000UTC.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Right. I guess that's it for 5.4? Anything we need to discuss for 6.0? (sorry to have taken up so much of the meeting time)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I just closed DS-2698 as fixed (merged to 6, backported to 5.4)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yay (to both)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; aschweer: you just commented on DS-1821, I think the possibility of saving that improvement is worth avoiding the revert</span><br />
