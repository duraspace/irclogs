<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; tdonohue: isn't that the same for this channel tho?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; oh i guess not…spoke too soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; eddies...  #duraspace has 3 folks with "op" privileges.  Myself, bradmc and mdiggory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, #fcrepo and #dspace seem similar in that no one seems to "own" them.  But, #duraspace is owned</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, that does bring up the point that in terms of IRC stuff, DuraSpace probably should "own" #fcrepo and #dspace.... Trying to recall how to request that from freenode folks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; i was just about to say i dunno how to request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (background for those listening in...eddies was asking me via email who owns #fcrepo.  I'm just realizing no one owns it or #dspace)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ditto here.  I'll dig around and see if I can figure out how to request ownership, eddies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; i'd like to drop #duraspace-ff in favor of #fcrepo. i don't want to go and change all our hooks that talk to #duraspace-ff though, unless #fcrepo is "ours"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; tdonohue++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;misilot&gt; tdonohue: <a href="http://blog.freenode.net/2008/04/registering-a-channel-on-freenode/">http://blog.freenode.net/2008/04/registering-a-channel-on-freenode/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; misilot - yea, I came across that. But, thanks!  I've asked over on #freenode to see if staff can help. Waiting still on a response.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;misilot&gt; ah ok:)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[17:50]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* PeterDietz (~peterdiet@128.146.173.112) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; eddies - I was just talking to a freenode staff member on #freenode.  They are discussing whether they can give me "op" on both #dspace and #fcrepo.  They did ask why we didn't just create new channels #duraspace-dspace and #duraspace-fcrepo and get immediate ownership of those.  But, I pointed out that #dspace and #fcrepo have been long standing channels.  Not sure what the result will be.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, it sounds like this is not something they take lightly (giving someone they don't know "op" access on a channel they don't know), which is both good and also makes this scenario a bit difficult.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; tdonohue: well, freenode has (temporarily?) suspended group registration, but per their old polcies at <a href="http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml">http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml</a> we would have been able to do #fcrepo and #dspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; i.e. we have well established projects under those names (dspace.org fcrepo.org) a legal entity behind it, etc. etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, agreed.  I forwarded them on the URLs for each of the projects and the URL for duraspace.org which "proves" ownership.  Just waiting to hear back (and not really sure how long I'll have to wait)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; yeah, and i would argue that the projects themselves stand alone—just like you wouldn't expect #jboss-&lt;insert-any-of-multitude-of-jboss-projects&gt; or #apache-NNN. neither dspace nor fedora started life out as part of duraspace either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;eddies&gt; anyway, sounds like you're on it and i'm just preaching to the choir =)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, yep. I've got the same opinions.  Just wanted to note what discussion has taken place so far</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[18:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I reiterated that same thing back to freenode staff just now...the response was "ok, we'll look into it and see what we can do"</span><br />
