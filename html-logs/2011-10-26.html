<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First &amp; foremost, 1.8.0 updates.   (Robint is off on holiday this week, fyi)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I was curious if anyone has any "outstanding" issues to still be resolved for 1.8.0?    Trying to nail down whether we try for release this week (Oct 28th), or if we push back one more week until robint returns (Nov 4).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I have something that still requires testing</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; what requires testing KevinVdV?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; DS-599</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; RobinT tested it on the DSpace demo server &amp; it worked there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; But it was hardly a couple of 1000 records to update</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; So I would like somebody with a HUGE solr to attempt the update script to ensure no out of memory errors occur</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I tested it with 200 000 records but my machine had 12GB of ram</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone have a larger solr data set that would be willing to help KevinVdV to test out Ds-599?   PeterDietz, are you around (I recall you had OutOfMemory issues previously -- be go to see if those are now fixed)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i can generate a huge index rather quickly ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i'm happy to help test this. i was meaning to put my hand up last week but had too much else on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hi all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Great thanks ksheperd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; yes, I've been meaning to test it. I've reported problems on previous patches</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks, kshepherd.  That'd be good.  (others are still welcome to test as well -- be good to ensure this is resolved once &amp; for all)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I don't know any way to pass my system information around (assuming I didn't mind you having access to our db+solr)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz &amp; kshepherd -- will you both be able to test it sometime this week?  It'd be good to test this *before* 1.8.0 final (and not after) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC there is a tool to generate as much log data as you want.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Should problems occur log them in the JIRA &amp; I will attempt to resolve them as quickly as I can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; tdonohue: yep will try my best</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, thanks.  would really like to ensure we are good with this before 1.8.0 (otherwise, we'd likely need to release an immediate 1.8.1 to fix issues)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Indeed tdonohue that is the reason why I keep bugging you guys about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- do you have a name of that tool?  Might be a good general resource for us for testing log related stuff  (so, if you find it, send it along)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, any other outstanding issues for 1.8.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; org.dspace.statistics.util.StatisticsDataGenerator</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- oh, yea, thanks. I forgot we had that (slaps forehead) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One other issue I've discovered -- not sure if it's a bug or not.    (1) 'ant update' and (2) 'ant -Dconfig=[path-to-dspace.cfg] update' behave slightly differently.   The former (#1) replaces your old dspace.cfg with a new one.  While the latter (#2) does not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would prefer and expect that (2) also replaces the .cfg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, that's what I initially expected as well.  So, I guess others agree this is likely a "bug"?  (if so, I can re-open DS-1060, which robint closed already)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Also, I've looked into this issue a bit yesterday &amp; I'm not sure if there is an easy fix or not.  So, if anyone has ideas, I'd love more "eyes" on this problem. It's rather annoying to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was just thinking, that I don't know if anyone has tested DS-528 - Podcasts</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood makes a note to look into ant problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; It works for us having an audio collection, however there are other materials that could be podcastable, and I haven't tested the case of someone podcasting PDF's into iTunes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; todonohue: I'll look into the ant issue, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood &amp; hpottinger.  I could really use the help.  I'll reopen Ds-1060 &amp; put my findings there (so feel free to add your own findings as well)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone willing to help PeterDietz to do some more testing of Ds-528?  Or anyone already done some testing  &amp; found it to have worked fine?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; been meaning to play with 528, but haven't gotten to it, yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any chance you (or others) could get to it later this week, or early next week?  (Trying to nail down our release timelines -- I'd obviously love to get this stuff all "tested" before we release 1.8.0)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...especially if that one is possibly one of the "What's New" features</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; i'll do some more testing of it.. and look for potential problems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'll add it to the list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I haven't visited that code in a while</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I have a not-quite-bug to report. XMLUI doesn't report the result text for all items that it runs curation task on.. but running curation via CLI reports results just fine</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; P.S. Google Mentor's summit was alot of fun. I got to meet Bojan</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- yea, that's a known thing with Curation Tasks.  It *logs* everything it interacted with though -- but the UI doesn't do the best at reporting everything, yet.  I think we may just have to "live with it" for 1.8.0 in that case.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- That's great!  Glad that GSoC Mentor's summit was fun!  I had forgotten that it was this past weekend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...our baby got bad jetlag, both ways, so I'm just catching up on sleep. PSS taking a red-eye home, and then working the following day is not fun</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so the latest status with 1.8.0 then seems to be:   Everything is "mostly done".  But, DS-528 &amp; DS-599 need more testing (we had several volunteers for each).  While DS-1060 needs fixing (we also had several volunteers to help chip in).  So, we are almost done here</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, because of the testing &amp; fixes that we just discussed, it sounds like we unfortunately need to push back another week &amp; release 1.8.0 *next week*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Does everyone feel comfortable with that?   (this does however mean that we all need to try and help test &amp; fix the above three issues this week &amp; early next week, if possible)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and documentation :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It would just be really good to get 1.8.0 nailed down.  This is the 2nd or 3rd delay already -- I'd hate to keep slipping back another week and another week, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, Documentation as well!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; What do others think about this?  Is it reasonable to get these 3 issues tested/fixed before say end-of-day on Monday, Oct 31?  I'd also like everyone to help read/skim through some of our docs, if you get a chance before then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (obviously by "reasonable" I'm assuming we don't find major issues/bugs.  If we do, then that would require us to push back again and fix them ASAP)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I can say that if people can test DS- 599 I can attempt to small fix issues found quickly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think this all sounds reasonable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood adding "by 31st" to my note.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; others?  PeterDietz, kshepherd? (as you were all volunteers above)  sound reasonable to get this "done" by end-of-day on Oct 31st?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'll test these 2 today (podcast, bitstream solr)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks PeterDietz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm assuming others are OK with this.  If you are not, please speak up.  If you can offer more help, also please speak up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Note for kshepherd -- I think we still need documentation from you around the new Curation tasks (Link Checker, MS Translator, etc.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, moving on to Documentation in general...

<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DevMtg 2011-10-26 - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2011-10-26">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2011-10-26</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The two ideas are:  (1) we move all the content from DSDOCDEV -&gt; DSDOC   (overwriting what is currently in DSDOC, or moving it elsewhere)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OR, (2) we move the content from DSDOCDEV to a new space "DSDOC18" (for 1.8).  This is the model that Fedora &amp; DuraCloud have started to take for their docs, as it's less "overwriting" and easier to manage in Confluence</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; For example, Fedora has their recent 3.5 docs at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35</a>  and their older 3.4 docs at: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA34">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA34</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Fedora 3.5 Documentation - Fedora 3.5 Documentation - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Fedora 3.4 Documentation - Fedora 3.4 Documentation - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA34">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA34</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we could do something similar, and move our 1.7 docs to "DSDOC17" and have the 1.8 docs at "DSDOC18", if we wanted.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Confused.  Doesn't DSDOC already contain multiple versions?  Wouldn't we just copy the content from DSDOCDEV to make one more?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm just curious here if anyone has any real "preferences" here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 2 seems safer, and duplicates the historical document nature that was previously provided by the embedded documenation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so if we have available versions, is there any way to have DSDOC be a link to the latest version, to avoid breaking any links to documentation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- DSDOC is the docs for 1.7.x essentially.  So, it doesn't cover DSpace 1.6.x, nor 1.8.x (obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-green">* hpottinger_ (80cea2c6@gateway/web/freenode/ip.128.206.162.198) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; what I'm suggesting is potentially the following.  Move DSDOC content to DSDOC17 (docs for 1.7.x).   Move DSDOCDEV to DSDOC18 (docs for 1.8.x).   From this point forward always create a new space for new versions of docs.  So, hypothetically, the docs for DSpace 7.0 would be at DSDOC70, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; if we don't like this idea, we can try and keep around a "DSDOC" which is always the *latest version*.   But, even doing that doesn't guarrantee that we won't "break links" -- e.g. if we change the name of a page in the Documentation between 1.7 and 1.8, then the older "1.7-style" DSDOC links may break.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ah.  What we have is static renderings of earlier releases' documentation, a "space" containing 1.7.x documentation, and another "space" containing 1.8.x documentation.  We're already doing the multiple "spaces" and we just need to adjust some names.  Right?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; (Confused looking at <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceResources#DSpaceResources-DocumentationandGuides,">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceResources#DSpaceResources-DocumentationandGuides,</a> which has links all the way back to 1.5.0, but they go to another server.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpaceResources - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceResources#DSpaceResources-DocumentationandGuides,">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceResources#DSpaceResources-DocumentationandGuides,</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; BTW that page also says that the latest doc.s are available in SVN.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- correct.  Right now it's all about adjusting some space names.  But, in the future, we will have a "standard" naming convention of "DSDOCxx" where "xx" refers to the major version number (e.g. "1.8.0 = DSDOC18"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; could possibly redirect DSDOC to whatever the current stable version number is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- that DSpaceResources wiki page does have old links that go to another server -- cause those docs don't exist anywhere on our wiki.  In the future it would just link to the appropriate wiki section</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- yea, we may be able to look into redirecting DSDOC to current stable version.  Or putting up a splash page which just links you off to all the available versions of DSpace Documentation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; I like the splash page redirect idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that would mean we'd do the following: (a)  DSDOC content moves to DSDOC17.  (b) DSDOCDEV content moves to DSDOC18 (c) create a new version of DSDOC which just links off to all available versions of DSpace Docs (and potentially tries to redirect you if we can figure out how to do that)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Does this sound OK to everyone?  I didn't want to jump in and just start moving around documentation without running it by everyone else.  So, if you disagree or are confused, let me know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; As long as people don't have to chase "current" as the software evolves, it sounds okay to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; of course, the splash page redirect would have to be careful about what it decides to reuse of the user's input... would be a perfect place for XSS attacks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hmm, gotta put my SEO hat on to think if creating multiple copies of the docs will hurt things too much, there's no way for GoogleBot to know to show you dsdoc18 over dsdoc17</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...but i was just thinking that would should also publish the latest javadoc to projects....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- yea, that's true.  But at the same time, what good does DSpace 1.8 docs do you if you are looking for 1.7 docs?  (i.e. if DSDOC is always just the latest version of docs, how do you ever find old versions?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ideally, it would all be inside of dsdoc, and I can choose from a dropdown to view a previous version... But i think that might be a limitation of confluence</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If you all want to see an example of this...take a closer look at what Fedora has done.   For example, in their *old* documentation (for 3.4) you'll notice it has a "NOTICE" at the top of the page which links you off to all available versions (to let you find the appropriate version): <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA34/Fedora+3.4+Documentation">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA34/Fedora+3.4+Documentation</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; could link to the newer docs from each page of the older docs (footer), that should raise the rank of the new dos, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Also, with Fedora, you'll see they have a left-sidebar set up to let you jump between versions of docs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The *current* release of Fedora docs is noted by a "green bar" at the top -- but, it still provides you with a link to find other versions: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/Fedora+3.5+Documentation">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FEDORA35/Fedora+3.5+Documentation</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I was thinking of doing something *similar* to what Fedora has done.   Fedora in turn basically copied this concept from Atlassian (makers of Confluence), as this is how they manage their docs in Confluence</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger_: yea, confluence provides a way to auto-link older docs to newer docs (or visa versa).  Notice that the headers our DSDOCDEV space all link back to "view this same page in the current documentation": <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOCDEV/DSpace+Documentation">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOCDEV/DSpace+Documentation</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Tim, I think your plan is fine. Java's javadocs over at Oracle, just have a number javase/1.4.2/docs, 1.5.0, 6, 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; I frankly really like the proposed approach</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; cool :) again, really just wanted to bounce this around, since we are getting near the end of 1.8.0 and need to move the DSDOCDEV content somewhere else anyways</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...no javase/latest/docs, but there is a splash page that says click here for 4, 5, 6, or 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, it sounds like most (at least those who are being vocal) think this sounds good.  So, I'll start moving in this direction for 1.8.0.  But, I'll send an email to dspace-devel before I actually move anything around (just as a warning to everyone)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Beyond that, I think 1.8.0 is doing well.  Please trying &amp; get your testing &amp; fixes &amp; docs review completed by end-of-day on Monday, Oct 31 (as requested above).   Robint &amp; I will then work on doing the 1.8.0 release mid-to-late next week.</span><br />
