<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; hey, mhwood, are we the meeting today?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So far, it seems so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger hands the gavel to mhwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; need one more to reach quorum, I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; well, we were talking about something last week, IIRC, something about data objects and making them usable?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I see some talk about Cocoon 2.2, Cocoon 3, and "after Cocoon".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; PeterDietz was talking about bolting new UIs on through REST.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ah, yes, after Cocoon, I remember that talk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm still trying to get to C3.  I managed to use NetBeans to build and run the sample "you're so smart you made Cocoon 3 work" webapp.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I was poking around the other day looking for other XML-based engines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; kept running into Xul-based things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; blundered into this list: <a href="http://java-source.net/open-source/xml-user-interface-toolkits">http://java-source.net/open-source/xml-user-interface-toolkits</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ugh, a common infrastructure that's always built with the application because Mozilla never got Firefox and Thunderbird onto the same XULrunner release....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; found this: <a href="http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/">http://luxor-xul.sourceforge.net/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Wow, that is seriously too many choices...and nothing familiar.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I agree, it's in my list of "explore this, later"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Luxor looks like another XML aspect, unrelated to what Cocoon does for us (the pipeline).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Oh, I see, there was a "Open XUL Alliance challenge" that might have encouraged "diversity"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I am pretty sure there isn't really anything like Cocoon out there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; this searching I did (by accident) all came up with lots of UI-centric development</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; which is interesting reading and might be fun to play with, but doesn't really count as web app development</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.  I'd really rather wind up with *fewer* (like, 1) UIs in the DSpace box and let people create alternatives out-of-tree, once we give them a fairly stable API to code to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Agreed. And it doesn't even really have to be XSLT/XML at all, just a simple template language would be sufficient</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; (There are some things that everybody seems to have a need to do:  UIs, fonts....  We wind up with huge collections of different ways to do the same thing, that are hard to tell apart.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Anything to make the job of random library coder/devops worker more familiar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Actually you could rip the UI off of the pipeline, too.  C3 is concentrating on the pipeline and paring away stuff that has been done by others, arguably better, since C2.1 or so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would kinda miss aspect-oriented page building.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; what are people using for UIs on C3?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Dunno, I only got one demo app. to run so far.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Lenya runs on Cocoon, wondering if they have C3 in the works?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; You *can* still translate XML to XHTML using Cocoon, but the emphasis has shifted away from Cocoon running the show.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; no mention of C3 on the Lenya roadmap (<a href="http://lenya.apache.org/index/roadmap.html)">http://lenya.apache.org/index/roadmap.html)</a> and they are both Apache wards.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Not surprising.  Cocoon looks stagnant to anyone not on the dev. team.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ugh, the dates on Lenya's road map are a decade past...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; You know, we are kinda  shining beacon on a hill when it comes to keeping the community informed...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-green">* PeterDietz (~peterdiet@128.146.173.70) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hi all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; hey there, peterdietz, mhwood and I are just boggling at out of date road maps (other projects, not ours, mind you)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so.. Not much agenda. Probably don't want to discuss too much without the horde</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 3 = horde</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Ohh, (reading scrollback), cocoon. Yeah, I don't want anything to do with that one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Hardy, did you say you mentioned the rest api demo site to someone.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Also, I know helix will kill me, for not updating the elastic search statistics page, but at OSU, we've been doing a crazy amount of improvements to elastic search statistics page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; yes, peterdietz, I did tell another developer here about the hedtek Demo on Demo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; One of the interesting things, the default data range is "last five years", then we report on a granularity of monthly downloads within that collection...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; [Robin Williams] Demo demo!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; he's a developer for the campus repository we just merged with our DSpace instance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; (oops, the interesting is in this line). So, when you request a time period that is a month or less, you get output in days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; crazy? improvements?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; And, my "Al Gore Rhythm" for choosing that allows you to bend your date range around a month.. i.e. what was our usage over xmas break: Dec 20 - Jan 10,, get days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; also, we've upgraded to using elastic search 0.19.11, (default dspace is 0.18.6), not sure if there's anything excited about the upgrade, but</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; anyway, back to REST-API demo, faculty are interested in being able to display a list of their resposited materials on their own pages.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; but, we changed our back-end architecture, and put elasticsearch on its own dedicated virtual server (since we have several webapps that run on ES)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; kompewter: define reposited</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Deposited in a repository?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But I'm not positive.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; yeah, so being able to display information in DSpace, outside of DSpace requires you to do something to share that data.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; A few approaches.. 1) Hacky XMLUI DRI way, Have researchers home-page have an ajax script that grabs raw data from xmlui's DRI thing, and embed that... probably will not work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; 2) Have a REST API that allows for searches, and read. So you could say /api/search?q=author:"Albert Einstein"&amp;results=Items or something (I just made up that syntax for search)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ah, yes, peterdietz, you weren't at OR11, where I think the verb "deposit" was coined</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; gah, silly fingers, "reposit: verb, to deposit in a repository"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; you can have little servlets to do novel things within your current site. i.e. we are using mhwood's content-statistics servlet for some of the basics... (semi-expensive operations) <a href="http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/content-statistics">http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/content-statistics</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; &lt;dspace-repository-statistics date="20130313T205713Z"&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="communities"&gt;170&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="collections"&gt;1425&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="items"&gt;51055&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="bitstreams"&gt;106717&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="totalMBytes"&gt;95917&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="images"&gt;78111&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt;     &lt;statistic name="imageMBytes"&gt;7937&lt;/statistic&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; &lt;/dspace-repository-statistics&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; planning to use that servlet soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ... but you could do things like this in a more organized fashion, and connected with structured ways to request this.. and for all objects.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; err, could do this better with an API..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; open search can probably suffice for this stuff, I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, it's a degenerate API.  One niladic operator.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm not an expert for sure, and don't know exactly what being a RESTful API means vs what is there now. But, its certainly the base layer I would prefer to build upon.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; but, I agree, if you're going to invest dev time, building against REST seems like a safer investment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; yep.. for instance the little toy-app I build, gives you a way to easily build against your repositories data: <a href="http://dspace-rest-client-play.herokuapp.com/item/45">http://dspace-rest-client-play.herokuapp.com/item/45</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Indeed, I am hopeful that my little servlet can be slurped up into the REST code and disappear in favor of /rest/site/statistics or some such.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; And then, something more programmatic (in an institutional sense, not in a thing built by programmers sense), is that you could build tools to help talk with your API.. i.e. Ruby Gem that lets any developer in Ruby config the url to their API (maybe also auth token), and then you can say foo = @dspace.communities.all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...and then being cool Acmeists ( <a href="http://acmeism.org/">http://acmeism.org/</a> ) that we all strive to be, we'll also build starter tools for users to rock&amp;roll with php, Java, cobol, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, you could hedge your bets and make pull requests against hedtek and Wijiti github forks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; we do need to "bring back" the rest api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; cobol, narf!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ooh, I haven't written any COBOL in two, three years.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I haven't played with Wijiti, but I imagine that its nothing scary.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I have played with Hedtek's API implementation, and it is nothing crazy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; R/W, with no authZ, kinda scary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Last time I played with dspace/rest-api thing, it was scary, created infinite loops, and took down tomcat. So as-is, we've got nothing to lose</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; If we had more horde present, I'd say I'd like to get input on possibly replacing current DSpace/dspace-rest with Hedtek's DSpace REST</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; But, in actuality.. We really ought to support full CRUD..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So, that was a premature statement. I'd like to inspect wijiti's before discussing bringing any one of them in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm OK with CRUD as long as we can also do authZ</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Figuring out authZ should be doable..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm also needing to figure out if these two have compatible endpoints.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Gotta let you two figure it out...'bye 'bye.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (mwood@mhw.ulib.iupui.edu) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So you could take your DSpace-REST-client, and point it at a demo of either one, and for read operations, get similar/same data ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; if that's not currently possible, it should be a small tweak to make them line up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; (but I'm a MVC guy, so who knowsâ€¦)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; And at the same time, I'd like to re-write (start de novo) the DSpace-rest-client that I've built, and make it in rails..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm also tempted to throw away the current rest implementations, and use the webMVC to manage building the rest api.. That was a very comfortable framework to use to build that webmvc webapp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; solo many paths....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; s/solo/so/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so.. I need a handler, who can help organize this thought into something that gives us good direction long-ish term, and makes good use of our time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; doh, wrong syntax, try that again, s/so/solo/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; If I do all that I just promised above.. I'll forget to eat for atleast 2 weeks.. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; kompewter is dead..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; anyways.. I've got some getting-back-to-work to do...</span><br />
