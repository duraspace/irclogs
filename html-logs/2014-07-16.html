<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; monikam_ : I don't see any difference in the two links you just pasted into IRC.  The error one and the "successful" one look like the same link to me?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; me neither - but the error is real</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First on the agenda for today though is a notice about the new 'dspace-tickets' mailing list : <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dspace-tickets">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/dspace-tickets</a>   This is a new notification-only mailing list for JIRA ticket updates (which are no longer being posted to dspace-devel)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; However, monikam_ has just notified me that she's seeing errors when trying to sign up for that new mailing list.  Is anyone else seeing the same thing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Hi tdonohue, could I briefly rudely interrupt?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: can we wait one moment?..after the dspace-tickets question. Then you can interrupt ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; No problem :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Have others successfully signed up to 'dspace-tickets'?  Just trying to see if anyone else is seeing issues in doing so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Trying now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Or, maybe no one else has tried yet ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; tim - I have signed up successfully - BUT for some very strange reason - when I click on the link in your email I get the error - after my browser briefly shows the  correct sign up page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; when I click on the link in the error page - things work as expected</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I just signed up using the link above</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Subscription request confirmed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; email received:  Welcome to the "DSpace-tickets" mailing list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. well, thanks for reporting monikam_.  As no one else has seen this yet, I'm not sure what could be going on.. I'm hoping it's just a "fluke" or something. But, I'll keep an eye out to see if others see similar issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; it looks like a fluke to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint, feel free to interrupt us now with your question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Very brief, I made a bit of mess of releasing the language packs today so would be grateful if anyone with Sonatype access could login and see if its looks sensible to them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I have no reason to believe otherwise, but would appreciate any reassurance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Thats all, thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: are they still sitting in the Sonatype "queue" or do you want us to verify the end results in Maven central?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (just want to know what I'm verifying</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; They still haven't appeared in Maven Central</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; according to this...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22dspace-api-lang%22">http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|a%3A%22dspace-api-lang%22</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; So really I was just looking for a quick sanity check in Sonatype</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Not that important given that it is just the lang packs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I don't want to divert this meeting so feel free to move on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Cheers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: One last question, did you already click "release"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Just wondering which steps you did here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure#ReleaseProcedure-VerifyandReleaseStagedArtifactsinSonatype">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure#ReleaseProcedure-VerifyandReleaseStagedArtifactsinSonatype</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; This is the point when I wish I had asked in private :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I am just going off to hit release now...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It looks like you've "closed" them. But you never actually "released" to Maven Central ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; No worries...I can understand that Sonatype's Web interface is quite confusing...it's the hardest part of the process, just understanding how to get things "sent" to Maven Central</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; After hitting "release" it'll probably take a good hour or two still for them to "appear".  There's often a delay, just as an FYI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. Moving back to the agenda now.. <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-16">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-16</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Speaking of dspace-tickets:  take a look at the archive.  Maybe we need a filter stage to render HTML mail to text/plain.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yuck, yea, the archive in SourceForge looks ugly. I'll see if I can find a way to tell SourceForge to expect HTML or similar (writing myself a note)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; back to agenda. Main topic for today is 4.2 release.  The 4.2 deadline is for fixes to be done by this Friday.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; A few of us reviewed the "unresolved" tickets for 4.2 prior to this meeting (in our JIRA Backlog hour).  There's still a few tickets that remain to be reviewed and either claimed or rescheduled though</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks like 1958 just reopened today, with a new PR.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, looks like it was just reopened 23 minutes ago.  PR is still running in Travis CI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 2035 has a PR, which has a +1 from KevinVdV.  So, it might just need a once over</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Currently assigned to me, but I don't know Solr well enough to judge some of this latest code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Got to run, thanks for the help.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, looking at these three... 1958 seems like the most important to get into 4.2.  The code looks "reasonable" at a glance, but likely does need a few tests (i.e. just test that full text indexing looks to still work, etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 2035 seems like it might just be "quickly merged" (looks minor, has a +1)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 1928 sounds like it has two different solutions -- there's a PR, and then a comment from Keiji that the simple solution is just to remove the &lt;description&gt; tag from the Identify response</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd be willing to claim &amp; do a quick test of *either* 1928 (the PR looks good to me actually) or 1958, if someone can claim the other.  Both of these PRs look reasonable at a glance...but I'd like to get a test in, if we can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, sounds like no takers here? hmm... I guess I can see what I can do here...or see if @mire can comment more on how well 1958 has been tested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case here, the 4.2 Release Deadline is still *this Friday* (unless there's a major reason for delaying again).  So, we'd definitely appreciate anyone who can chip in on testing or merging of the last few tickets.

<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Issue Navigator - DuraSpace JIRA ] - <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;jqlQuery=project+%3D+DS+AND+fixVersion+%3D+4.2+AND+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+due+ASC%2C+priority+DESC%2C+created+ASC&amp;mode=hide">https://jira.duraspace.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;jqlQuery=project+%3D+DS+AND+fixVersion+%3D+4.2+AND+resolution+%3D+Unresolved+ORDER+BY+due+ASC%2C+priority+DESC%2C+created+ASC&amp;mode=hide</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That's all the 4.2 updates / discussion that I had.  We'll obviously update folks on the release process for 4.2 on the lists.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; At this point, we do have time (20mins) for open discussion.  One topic I'd like to specifically concentrate on is whether we want to try and support more Q&amp;A on StackOverflow.com.  The Committers have been chatting off &amp; on (since OR14) about finding ways to encourage Q&amp;A in other forums (as mailing lists are hard to search / vote up answers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, we've been brainstorming on using StackOverflow more. There's already a "dspace" tag there (but very few questions so far): <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dspace">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dspace</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Newest 'dspace' Questions - Stack Overflow ] - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dspace">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dspace</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As a sidenote: if you have a StackOverflow account, it is possible to "subscribe" to email updates to the "dspace" tag.  I know many of the Committers have already done so. So, we are now "tracking" any new questions that come in there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any thoughts on this idea?.... or other brainstorms?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; did anybody look into whether the stack overflow questions come from people that subscribe to dspace-devel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; At first glance I only recognize one name.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; also the dspace tag does is not very active   - Jul , Mar , Mar, Jan â€¦</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; monikam_ : so far, StackOverflow is not very widely used for DSpace questions (only 21 in 4 years).  So, I suspect little overlap.  The idea here though would be to *replace* either dspace-devel or dspace-tech mailing lists, but perhaps to encourage more Q&amp;A to happen via StackOverflow....so this would likely move some traffic from dspace-tech and dspace-devel to StackOverflow, but not all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; not sure - being in two places - is a good idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, there's currently very little DSpace activity on StackOverflow, because up until a few weeks ago (at OR14) very few Committers were tracking questions there...so there were many unanswered questions, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; two places means -  looking for answer must be done in two places</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I guess you meant "The idea here though would *not* be to *replace*...."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; whoops..yes *not* to replace dspace-devel or dspace-tech</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Two places:  yes, that's why I just subscribed, so I can get emails and direct them to my dspace-tech folder with the rest.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If you like RSS you can get notices that way too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The big problem we are currently having on mailing lists  (esp dspace-tech) is that it seems like there are many questions which seem to either (a) Be the same question over and over, an FAQ, or (b) go unanswered or get "lost" in the stream of emails</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; two places in search for answers - how often do you think users look through the mailing archive in search for  ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, this is why we've been brainstorming whether mailing lists are truly the best way to do Q&amp;A.  The advantage of something like StackOverflow is that the "best answers" get voted up and stick around and are easy to find (via Google).  On mailing lists, the best answers get "buried" sometimes or are hard to re-locate</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And on mailing lists the same questions get asked over and over.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I keep my own archives of interesting listmails, ever since the SourceForge email archives trained me to not even think about trying to use them.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; good point - about good answers bubbling up - but if most activity is on the mailing list - stack overfow will no do much for you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Again though...this is just an "idea" / brainstorm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; monikam_: I agree. StackOverflow without any questions is not so useful.  So, the first step would be to encourage folks to actually ask &amp; answer questions there...but it's hard to say how best to do that or whether it will be successful right away</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've been playing around (since OR14) with StackOverflow though...and recently realized that they *encourage* folks to even ask &amp; answer their own questions: <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Itâ€™s OK to Ask and Answer Your Own Questions Â« Blog â€“ Stack Exchange ] - <a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/07/its-ok-to-ask-and-answer-your-own-questions/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Which does mean that we *could* "pre-seed" StackOverflow with some common DSpace questions...as a way to encourage more people to go there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; I like the idea of trying to avoid  repeat questions and answers - if stack overflow is to work - most of the dspace a&amp;a  stuff should move over there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; so answering your own questions might be a way to do it and then   pointing over to stackoverflow in the email list interactions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; monikam_ +1 on both points.  That's been my thinking so far...but I didn't want to jump in that direction before consulting with other developers, etc.  We'd need to get many of us behind that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; that could be an as you  go kind of thing - if there is a question on the mailing list that is a repeat - create Q&amp;A on stackoverflow and link there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood wonders if anyone has tried e.g. a Bayesian classifier to recognize FAQs and auto-respond.  Probably the classifier should be part of a collection of tools that some rudimentary AI would try...argh, solution growing much faster than the problem.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; maybe a RoboKelpChat is the next step â€¦</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; RoboHelpChat    yikes I need a RoboTyper</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I was wondering what a "KelpChat" was ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Crosstalk from that NPR story this morning about kelp-based beer?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; nope</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it seems we really only have 3 of us here today (not enough to get a good "sample" of whether most folks like this StackOverflow idea, yet).  But, does this seem reasonable?  Maybe we need to start a public thread/discussion on dspace-devel or dspace-tech (or both) to see what others think and if they will help out?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's something I can live with, and it may turn out to be a great thing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; there is two more other issue : are people as comfortable asking on stack overflow as they are on dspace-tech ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; 2) the many little issues that DSPACE has, real or perceived  will be much more public</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We'd need to give some advice:  questions of opinion ("which is the best...") tend to get shut down quickly on SO.  Send those to the ML instead.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; good question, monikam_  I don't know the answer.  RE #1: I do know that StackOverflow supports "anonymous" questions though (you don't need an acct), whereas dspace-tech requires some form of "signup"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; the plus side - people answering will collect wizard points on stackoverflow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; #2 may be the push we need to clean up the many little issues and the reasons we have many little issues.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; RE #2: I'm OK with that. Yes, DSpace is a 10+ year old system, and as such has quite a few little annoyances. But, in order to get them fixed, sometimes we need to make them more "public"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;monikam_&gt; goto go</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* monikam_ (~Monika_Me@monika.Princeton.EDU) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I agree with your point about ML vs SO.  Some questions would not be allowed on StackOverflow, as they do shutdown any "subjective" questions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, we'd need to clarify which questions we recommend on each</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we are now past time...and I think there's only two of us left.  So, we may as well close up for today. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK.  Discussion seems to have wound down anyway.  Probably ought to float the SO idea on -tech to see if it's attractive.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; -tech or -devel?  I was actually thinking possibly -devel first...to see if other Developers will participate...if so, then we bring it to -tech to try and encourage folks to ask questions there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds okay to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok..will start a thread on -devel first, see what response we get there</span><br />
