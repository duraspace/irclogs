<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kstamatis&gt; helix84: sure. I have already seen them, I will have another look as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, it's time for our weekly DSpace Developers Mtg.  Agenda: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2013-10-23">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2013-10-23</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Obviously our main topic for today is 4.0, and getting ready now for RC1 (Oct 31) followed by Testathon (Nov 4-15)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, first and foremost, I did want to see what we want to do about the few PRs that looks like they "missed" Feature Freeze: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues?milestone=1&amp;state=open">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/issues?milestone=1&amp;state=open</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; What is the latest status there? Is it right to assume they are delayed until after 4.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think 1028 will need to wait.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-green">* aschweer (~schweer@schweer.its.waikato.ac.nz) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; also 1519 need to be postponed as it has bugs and some point unclear</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; both are close...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* robint (5eaf588c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.94.175.88.140) Quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, sounds reasonable. So, we should remove the "4.0" tag from both, it sounds like, and revisit them post-4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 1519 in particular is not something we want to sneak in, I don't think, as it's a change to the workflow and submission process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not hearing any disagreement here, so I'll change them both so they are post-4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and remove them from the milestone?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-green">* robint (5eaf588c@gateway/web/freenode/ip.94.175.88.140) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, exactly hpottinger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I have written to the original submitter of 1519 so he should know that the PR was not ready for 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, both have their milestone removed &amp; fix version set to "none" now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Are there any other outstanding (non-bug fix or severe bug) tickets we need to quickly review right now?  Just want to see if there's anything else out there that is imperative to decide on ASAP</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; on the note of sneaking things in, I'd like to ask RT to merge my let PR (you approved an exception in the lasr DevMtg): <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/345">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/345</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DS-1514 AIP import simple embargo by helix84 · Pull Request #345 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/345">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/345</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Also has a very recent comment.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; Peter's and Hardy's comments have been resolved. Bram and Tim were able to do a test, Tim may want to give some details about his comments.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I had noted one (minor) concern on helix84's work... I think it's mostly good, but I suspect a minor refactor is in order (helix84 &amp; I tried to do a quick refactor this morning, but had no success)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; just to be clear, RT does not merge, committers merge, so you're asking for a release from feature freeze policy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the refactor could come later (after merger), as I haven't verified the possible bug.  But, the code looks odd to me in one area</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: I agree with your analysis, probably there is a bug (not testet yet)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; however, my "suspicions" probably shouldn't hold up a vote on merge or not.  I haven't proven my suspicion yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and if there are issues, we can do a quick bug-fix before RC1)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, that's what this coming week is for.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue's note doesn't seem like a blocker, are we OK with letting in DSPR#345?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm for fix that and after perform the merge. It is not really a new feature in some way it is a bug fix or an improvement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; actually, I tested the scenario that Tim suggested would produce a bug and it works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/345">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/345</a> ] - DS-1514 AIP import simple embargo by helix84</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; bollini is right, this does feel more like a bug fix than a feature</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the refactor we tried produces a bug and also changes order of DSOs and resourcepolicies, so it may not be the best solution (though that might have been just the implementation)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it is a "gray" area...could be voted either way.  But, personally I'd like to see 345 get into 4.0 (and we can work out any bugs in the coming week(s))</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: ok if you have performed the test we should merge. If there are other bugs we can fix later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok, try to vote</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; +1 to merge now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 merge now, helix84 pushes the button</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 as well, 345 is at least *better* than what we currently have</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 0, I don't understand the issues well enough.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; any vetos?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok so vote pass... helix84 please push the button!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; done</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; excellent.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, anything else PR-wise outstanding for 4.0 merger?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I think there's one PR that we missed somehow</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I rebased it here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; (originally DSPR#266)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I (vaguely) recall there being some controversy around the new Collection View.  With this PR, do Collection homepages still have their logo &amp; description (I remember they did not in an early version of this work)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; that's why it's disabled by default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, ok. didn't realize it's disabled by default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; RT?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm 0 with that... I only not appreciate that this specific PR has received some concern and has been not managed in time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we're not really the deciders :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; this is not addressed to you, Ivan</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: sorry, what concern?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; but we really have not given a priority to this PR so it has not meet the deadline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it looks like a white robit for me to have it now ready to merge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'm not sure how it missed the deadline because it's been open for 3 months</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it missed the "merge" deadline. The PR was created on-time, but wasn't merged on-time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok, I could be wrong... but was it mergeable? are we agreed about the implementation before?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thinking out-loud here....It looks like the only way to enable this new Collection view is by editing a Spring XML config: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/349/files#diff-eb41d8cfa0737f07840838d3b8633f08L138">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/349/files#diff-eb41d8cfa0737f07840838d3b8633f08L138</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* helix84 shouldn't have missed that Friday meeting :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; [14:20] &lt;bollini&gt; 266: NO | Need rebase</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It seems like there's two option: (1) sneak it in...likely not many folks will even enable this immediately...and work towards hardening it so it can be made the "default view", or (2) leave it out, try and better nail down what the Collection homepage *should* look like, and build a better one in 5.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; if it's not on by default, then I don't have a problem with it, and it would be handy to have around for people who decide it's bothersome that no content shows on the collection homepage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84 can just say "just change this config and you'll be golden"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; even better, I can document it ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; the big problem here is that when you "enable it", you no longer have Collection logos or metadata displayed.  Cause of that, I know I personally wouldn't use this right now. But, I won't stand in the way if others see a big benefit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok, looking to it now I note two things</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, PR#266 does two things?   Adds a "show more" to recent submissions (everywhere) and , when enabled, adds a new collection view option?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I meant PR#349 obviously (266 is the old replaced one). but, that's good to know</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I want to make a suggestion for all us, we should clean the jira 4.0 version</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I mean that we should check that all the JIRA issue related to PR that has been merged are closed (some marked with documentation need)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; You mean change all Fix for:4.0 to Fix for:4.1/5.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I do want to mention... the 4.0 Release Notes are looking AWESOME (great work all): <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+4.0+Notes">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+4.0+Notes</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; bug fix should be managed with agility</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the committer that has merged or better know the underline code should be free to merge</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I hear you and I'm merging a couple of ready bug-fixing PRs :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, let's bug fix rapidly. If you are unsure, get a second opinion, but no need to let things sit around if you are sure of the fix.  (and also no need to let bug fixes wait for multiple +1's)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; as we are approaching to the end of the meeting I want to ask two things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; with EKT we have introduced a new select-collection step for the submission that introduce the bibliographic lookup only for jspui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it supports the legacy select collection, this mean that enabling it doesn't break the xmlui submission</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; should we consider to enable it by default? now it isn't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; in the past we agreed that XMLUI vs JSPUI feature parity is not a requirement; so as long as the change doesn't break XMLUI, it's good to go</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; until it is well tested, I'd recommend "disable by default".  We can always switch it later after testathon if it seems very stable / good to enable by default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; bollini;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kstamatis&gt; moreover, it allows the default manual submission as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Oops, sorry, finger trouble!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: so we can enable it for the testhaton and decide later?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; for testathon, we usually attempt to enable *everything* (as long as it doesn't break one of the UIs).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So the Testathon server can be setup with it enabled.  Then we can decide after testathon whether to release 4.0 with it enabled or disabled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I agree with that approach</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the second related question is: are you fine if we disable the initial question by default in 4.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +10000 (can I vote that much?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we have already discussed that but we don't have yet a PR (but it is very trivial)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'm not using submission forms, but when I do (for testing(m the initial step always bothers me. So a small +1 from me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; Ok if nobody will do it first I will change that before the RC1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds reasonable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: that fixes it in XMLUI, too, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, regarding Testathon, we need to announce the dates (very soon)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Original dates still doable?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I suspect so. Seems like we are getting there in a timely fashion. But, we do need to concentrate on bug fixes &amp; Documentation updates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we need also to find volunteer to update the server... I'm saying that because I will be not available for that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As part of the "Testathon announcement", it'd also be a great opportunity to highlight the new features coming (by linking to the nice looking 4.0 Release Notes page)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can announce dates then, if we are ready to do that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The notes page, definitely.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; here's the 4.0 tasks (started by hpottinger): <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+4.0+Tasks">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+4.0+Tasks</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, no, helix84 and robint get credit for really doing the heavy lifting on the new features list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; sidenote: I actually created a 5.0 release notes page where I moved the suggestions from the 4.0 release notes page which didn't get into 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I just filled in some pretty pictures that helix84 helpful noted that we needed</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm going to have to leave.  Anything else?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It'd be great if we can get a "rough draft" of the documentation ready by testathon too...that way folks can test the upgrade docs, etc.  But, we do need to ensure someone (anyone) is able to help on docs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: could you write docs on how to disable discovery and enable lucene?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; anybody want to review the install and upgrade docs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I know Bram has already been cleaning up docs, but I'm not sure what is missing from docs</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd also be glad to try and review docs... I'm not sure if I'll have enough time to devote to writing any, but I'm glad to give things a read and cleanup the language as needed</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; bollini meant to say: just noted that we have miss the new submission lookup in the new jspui features list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it sounds like we may still need some documentation helpers.  I wonder if the RT would be willing to ask around on dspace-release or dspace-devel/committer?  I suspect others would be willing to chip in if they knew it was needed.  Plus, it couldn't hurt to see if those that created new features could send some draft docs along</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: feel free to add it, I really made only a rough list</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: ok, but you should propose an icon :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: umm..yea, bamboo is still random about it's failures.  I have a few PRs to try and do a little unit testing cleaning (will merge later today), but I'm not sure they actually fix the random bamboo failures (the randomness is hard to replicate)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it's not bamboo, it's our tests that are randomly failing/passing :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep..*most of the time* our tests work. Some of the time, they randomly fail all over the place.  The exact cause is still unknown as no one seems to be able to get the tests to fail consistently.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I can promise him a drink in Helsinki if he manages to fix that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; is that motivation enough? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any last items to discuss today?  Is the RT comfortable with next steps here?
