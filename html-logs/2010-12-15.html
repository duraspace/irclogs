<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all -- normally we'd have a DSpace Devel. Mtg right about now.  But, unfortunately, I'm a bit swamped this week because of the upcoming 1.7.0 release, and helping both Peter Dietz &amp; Jeff Trimble (with the release and the documentation, respectively).   Everything is still "on-time", and 1.7.0 will be formally released on Friday -- but, there's just a lot of last-minute stuff to do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If anyone has some extra time today / early tomorrow, I'd appreciate a second pair of eyes on the 1.7.0 Upgrade Docs.  I wrote and tested them a while back, but I wanted to be certain they are clear enough (and they should be double checked for inaccuracies): <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/Upgrading+a+DSpace+Installation">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC/Upgrading+a+DSpace+Installation</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Beyond that, I don't have anything to bring to a meeting today.  Still working hard to help get 1.7.0 wrapped up.  If there are any questions/comments, feel free to ask!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-green">* sandsfish (~sandsfish@75-138-180-114.dhcp.oxfr.ma.charter.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt;  Hi all,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; haven't had time to test it but there is an emsil in dspace-tech that suggests Sword doesn't work with Discovery turned on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; s/emsil/email</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well we probably should try and test that, and see if there is an odd SWORD/Discovery conflict (even if just so we can report that as a "known issue").  Any volunteers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: Cant tonight but could do tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; tdonohue: i have some updates for the 'upgrading to 1.6' section of those docs. I'm not going to get to them until this afternoon though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well, anytime is good.  At this point, it's unlikely we'd have a fix ready for 1.7.0 anyways (unless it's a really simple problem).  So, it'd just be good to verify whether there is an issue, and if so, log it in JIRA as a "known issue"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; FYI for all -- I plan to "close the door" on 1.7.0 at about 10:00 EST Thursday (tomorrow).  That's 15:00 UTC on Thursday.  After that, anything else will have to wait for 1.7.1 or 1.8.0.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; tdonohue: OK, thank you, I'll try and get them done today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; BTW, Thanks for all the hard work lately guys!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Maven problems can be particularly frustrating.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; tdonohue: could you add a note on the recommended versions of java/maven/ant/tomcat into the docs on upgrading to 1.7?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea -- those Maven issues were a bit of a pain. My week has been a bit busier than expected :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: I'm at a place where I could do a test install of 1.7.0, have an unused developer space to park it in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; snail -- do you mean, provide an update there about the new recommended versions of each?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; in the wiki on the upgrade</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; snail -- good idea!  I'll make sure we get that in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- feel free to put up a test instance.  We'll also make sure to upgrade <a href="http://demo.dspace.org/">http://demo.dspace.org/</a> to the official 1.7.0 release, once it has been "cut"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any other thoughts/comments/questions around 1.7.0?  Again, would like a volunteer or two to at least read through the 1.6.x -&gt; 1.7.0 upgrade docs (want to make sure everything makes sense, and nothing was overlooked on accident)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; i'll scan through that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks sandsfish -- i appreciate it!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Did we really want to have sentences bracketed by underscores, or was that supposed to be italic?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- if you see that anywhere in the docs, it's a formatting error.  was likely supposed to be italic.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-green">* jefftrimble (~jefftrimb@maag127.maag.ysu.edu) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; FYI -- Jeff Trimble &amp; I have been doing major cleanup of the Wiki Docs the last few days.  Jeff is working hard today to cleanuup the Configuration section -- so, it may still be slightly messy in areas (but should be cleaned shortly)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; there's jefftrimble now :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, if anyone has time -- we'd definitely appreciate more eyes on the Wiki Docs.  We think we've caught *most* of the bad formatting/typos.  But, more eyes always helps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; fyi -- Committers have access to edit this area.  If you are not a committer, and have not previously asked for permission to edit from Jeff or I, then you likely won't have access.  However, we are very willing to give others edit access, as long as you are not a "spammer" :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in case that previous statement isn't clear:  everyone can view the Wiki-based Docs, but only trusted folks can edit them.  Just ask if you want 'edit' permissions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any other comments/questions, etc.?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt;  tdonohue: could you give me access please? I'm Stuart.Yeates@vuw.ac.nz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, snail, you now have edit rights to the official Docs in the Wiki.  Let jefftrimble or I know if you have any questions, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt;  tdonohue: cool. I'm in the same timezone as kshepherd, so hopefully it'll enable me to make my own corrections rather than forwarding them to him.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; re: Discovery and SWORD -- if something's broken, it's just the event consumer stuff, because that's the only part i haven't tested yet (and am testing now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, I for one will be glad to see 1.7.0 released in a few days time!  Thanks to everyone for all your hard work in making 1.7.0 happen!   I'll hang around here for a while in case there are questions, but otherwise, consider the meeting adjourned, and take the extra 20 minutes to help us read through the Docs and look for formatting or other errors.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Thanks tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Preface introduces a list of new features and then gives none.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- thanks, looks like we forgot to update that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i'll fix it shortly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Same page:  Sands Fish and Javier Garrido are two separate people, yes?  "Keller", "Caryn", and "Nieswender" have only one name?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* alxp (~alxp@PC044.ROBLIB.UPEI.CA) Quit (Quit: alxp)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Fixed both of those -- "Keller" is actually a single name -- that's how that person is also listed here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceContributors">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpaceContributors</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think we must've not gotten a first name there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's why I didn't just fix it -- I was unsure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* ksclarke (~kevin@adsl-235-136-109.clt.bellsouth.net) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; two things related to Oracle: ojdbc info needs updating (both link to download and command to type), also, the version required in the pom.xml is not appropriate for Java6. As soon as I confirm which version should go in there, I'm happy to update the wiki, if I can have write permissions set: pottingerhj@umsystem.edu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; tdonohue, the addition of the Google Scholar configuration entries is not listed in the upgrade steps that list config file edits:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; ##### Google Scholar Metadata Configuration #####</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; google-metadata.config = ${dspace.dir}/config/crosswalks/google-metadata.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; google-metadata.enable = true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; I'll edit that in if you want.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sandsfish -- can you add them in the appropriate place?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; yup.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; build of 1.7.0 against Oracle finally proceeding, using ojdbc6.jar, had to change all the poms, if I can confirm it's working, I'll submit a patch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i've reproduced the sword+discovery problem (replied to dspace-tech with stack trace)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; similar issue as the original reporter... things go pear-shaped after events are fired right at the end (or just after?) ingest via SWORD</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; s'pose i should look closer at dspace-services</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd -- can you enter that as a formal issue in JIRA?  so that we have it logged as a known issue in 1.7.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* jefftrimble (~jefftrimb@maag127.maag.ysu.edu) Quit (Quit: Leaving)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; tdonohue: yep, will do.. just want to see if i should be logging it in dspace or DSCR or DSRV (though i might not be able to figure out that much! if in doubt i'll log it as a DS ticket)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, at very least, log as a DS ticket -- we can always move tickets around, or link them together if related</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: if you can give me write permission to the wiki, I'll update the Oracle info. Putting together a patch for the changes to the pom files, to use ojdbc6.jar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- what is your Wiki username?  need that to give you edit access rights</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: pottingerhj@umsystem.edu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, you now have edit rights, hpottinger.  FYI, this area of the wiki is more "managed", so several of us get notifications of updates so we can do a brief review.  Obviously though, feel free to make whatever changes are needed -- we want to have  many people helping to make the documentation better!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; also, hpottinger, try and post any patches ASAP (or send my way).  I'll be closing the DSpace 1.7.0 release tomorrow morning -- so patches need to be accepted before then.  Assuming it's minor, shouldn't be a big deal, just need to get it soon.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; todonohue: wrangling it right now, want it on JIRA or just to you?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Needs to get to JIRA eventually (for issue tracking) -- but you are welcome to also send to me (it's up to you, I'll be watching JIRA anyways)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i don't want to mess with AbstractDspaceTransformer too much, and also don't want that ugly cocoon bug meaning we replace our 500 status codes with 200 status codes, even if we're *trying* to send 404s...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: what's left with it? Is it just the fact that XMLUI itself isn't returning 404s properly (cause of Cocoon bug)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; but we'll see how i go</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok -- i see.  well, if it's not fully fixed, we'll reschedule for 1.7.1.</span><br />
