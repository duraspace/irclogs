<span class="irc-date">2:55:07 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Late reminder that we do have a DSpace DevMtg today at the top of the hour (in 6mins).  We'll likely keep it short & mostly specific to DSpace 6.3 pending release (cause of the DSpace 7 Sprints going on this week).  Agenda: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2018-05-09</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">3:01:12 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> <here>: It's DSpace DevMtg time. Let's kick things off with a quick roll call to see who is here</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:01:20 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> here!</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:01:26 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> here</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:01:26 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <jcreel256> lurking</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:01:33 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <mwood> Hi.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:02:57 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Cool, a nice crowd.  So, first off, I'm noticing/realizing (just now) that it is a tad awkward holding a DevMtg at the same time as a DSpace 7 Sprint (in that I'm answering questions in dev-sprint and jumping back here to type again).  So, if I go quiet, that's why ;)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:03:16 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> In any case, let's dive in...I'll likely keep this meeting a bit specific to 6.3 overall</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:04:44 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Quick updates... The Sprint is going on (but you all know that).  The cool thing is we have 8 participants, and most of them are newer folks.  Primarily based in USA & Europe though.  If you are interested in who they are, the list is here: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+Community+Sprints#DSpace7CommunitySprints-ParticipantSignups</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">3:05:23 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Beyond that, not much to report on the DSpace 7 side...we'll be sprinting & then prepping / preparing for OR2018</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:06:41 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Our next Dev Show & Tell is next week (May 15). Agenda is Docker related, see: https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Dev+Show+and+Tell+-+May+15%2C+2018+-+1500UTC</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">3:07:25 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> I don't think I have anything else to mention right now...so, I think we can move along to DSpace 6.3 status / updates.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:07:36 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> I have been pleased to see that the video from the last show and tell has been useful for sprint participants!</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:08:00 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> After the next show and tell, I will be looking for topic ideas.  Send me a message if you have any good suggestions.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:08:56 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> @terrywbrady: we also could be in search of Dev Show & Tell topics at OR2018</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:09:19 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> Good idea.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:09:25 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> (Which reminds me... writing a note to myself to *mention* Dev Show & Tell at OR2018)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:11:09 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Ok, so on to 6.3 updates.  @kshepherd, would you be interested in leading this segment?  I feel like I'm loosing track of what is left in 6.3 (but I know you have it well in hand)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:11:25 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> hah</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:11:55 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> Yep sure :slightly_smiling_face: Well... we're about at the last push for getting PRs merged into dspace-6_x branch, to give time for testing before a May 21 release</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:12:33 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> I've got a list of PRs I was hoping to get some eyes on at today's meeting if we have time as they just need another review to make it in</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:13:22 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> I think we have the remainder of the meeting (though I'd look to everyone else hear to speak up if you feel going through 6.3 PRs is not the best usage of today)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:13:23 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> I've also added a list of some general tests we should think about once dspace-6_x is stable for a week or so before May 21</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:13:37 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+6.3+Status#DSpaceRelease6.3Status-Suggestedpre-releaseapplication(usability,functional)testsforDSpace6</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:13:38 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> kompewter: [ DSpace Release 6.3 Status - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+6.3+Status#DSpaceRelease6.3Status-Suggestedpre-releaseapplication(usability,functional)testsforDSpace6</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:14:28 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> Do those tests look good for all? if you'd like to help out with them / if one is your area of expertise, etc., perhaps you could add your name to it or ping me in a /msg so I can get in touch once we're ready for a pre-release test?</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:16:23 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Those seem good to me.  I'd be willing to help test (in general). We also can do a early deploy to demo.dspace.org if that helps in any of this testing</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:16:24 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> I added my name next to legacy rest.  I can do Solr and CSV as well.  But, I will be out of the office the week of 5/21.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:17:03 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> Cool, thanks both. Yep demo site might be good, and I don't mind throwing up an amazon box for a week either</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:17:50 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> So other than that, I just wanted to note that help is still wanted / appreciated particularly in final reviewing/testing PRs and writing documentation for merged code that needs it, and to go through a list of PRs that need another +1</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:18:03 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> demo site update would be one way of also testing the Flyway upgrade / migration parts.  I might be able to shave off time to do that in the next week</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:18:39 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> If we have time for that, I'll start listing :slightly_smiling_face: But will give others a chance to discuss other topics / agenda first in case that's not the best use of meeting time</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:19:12 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> Lets go through the list quickly.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:19:17 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> @tdonohue also, I'll be in touch soon to refresh myself on the release procedures, sonatype stuff, checking my keys are still valid, etc... is the wiki doc up to date?</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:19:47 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> @kshepherd: yes, the wiki is as up to date as it can be.  We update it every release ;)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:19:53 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> OK. List of PRs that need a +1</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:19:55 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> DS-3447 https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2039</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:19:55 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> kompewter: [ https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3447 ] - [DS-3447] Transition ORCID integration to ORCID API 2.0 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:20:00 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> kompewter: [ DS-3447 : ORCID v2 integration (using DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api) by tdonohue · Pull Request #2039 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/2039</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:21:06 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> This has been tested by me and Tim, and we think it's given ORCID functionality back to DSpace authority as it was in the ORCID v1 API. There are further improvements that can be made, and I still haven't heard back from atmire as to how their constructors/beans/spring configs are working compared to old (there seems to be some config stuff missing), but I think we should Just Get It In, personally</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:21:40 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> One quick thing to note on #2039 is that it is dependent on merging & releasing https://github.com/DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api/pull/1   I can release this, as needed, but I'd like someone else to +1 that PR (it's code is used by #2039, so it's already being tested)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:21:43 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> kompewter: [ ORCID 2.1 generated source based on ORCID-Source XSDs on 2018-04-23 by tdonohue · Pull Request #1 · DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api · GitHub ] - https://github.com/DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api/pull/1</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:21:49 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> Ah, yes, good point</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:22:34 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> I've just added my approval to the jaxb PR</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:22:38 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> If others are ok with my moving this forward, I likely can find time to do so.  I've just been waiting for someone to make the merge button "green" ;)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:22:49 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Thanks @kshepherd</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:23:16 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> The PR is big, so it is difficult to do a quick spot review.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:23:55 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> @terrywbrady Yes. So, in lieu of a full review... if you/others support merging #2039 in general then I'll just do it after the jaxb is merged -- it works, and it doesn't work in 6.2, and it doesn't break authority. So, low impact in my opinion.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:24:33 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <terrywbrady> Yes, I support the idea.  I just have not had time or focus to review it.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:24:35 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> @terrywbrady: That `orcid-jaxb-api` PR is all auto-generated code (I didn't write a line of it).  But, I think we've sufficiently proven it "works" via PR#2039</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:24:53 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <mwood> So long as it's better than doesn't-work-at-all (what we have now) that seems right.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:25:34 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> yep. And we can re-generate the code (to fix it) if necessary in the future.  How that code was auto-generated is documented in the README: https://github.com/DSpace/orcid-jaxb-api/blob/master/README.md</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">3:33:43 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> RE:2048 The one risk to Flyway upgrades is that all Flyway upgrades are not equal... Flyway sometimes adds in new features or version incompatibilities in new releases.  So, we might want to verify in going from Flyway 4.0.3 -> 4.1.2 that we are just getting bug fixes</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:34:33 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Since it's been tested to work, it sounds like it should be a "safe" Flyway upgrade.  But  I know (for example) that in upgrading from Flyway v3 to v4, we actually had to change some of our code (in minor ways)</span><br/>

The method that is changes, existed already before the PR in both UIs. It would be better to have it in the API, but I’m afraid that is beyond the scope of a reasonable patch for a minor release.</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">3:47:17 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> perhaps someone could attach a +1 if they're sufficiently happy / have tested</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:48:30 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> @pbecker yes, this occurred to me too. the Solr service impl is probably the place to be doing special character handling.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:49:20 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> @pbecker if you think a future DSpace 7 fix (in API) for this is likely and once ported to 6.x, would result in double-encoding of values (and therefore, we'd have to revert this patch), then we should probably note that and hold off merge until more discussion</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:50:39 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <pbecker> I think we will have the same bug in DSpace 7 and will have to close it than again. If we add this code now as it is, we have a blueprint for a solution.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:50:55 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> I think i'll note that in github convo now</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:51:04 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <pbecker> We can decide then if we solve this in angular / JavaScript, in REST or in the backend.</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:51:26 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> definitely not in Angular ;)  This should be in REST or Java API layer in DSpace 7</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:51:31 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> whether we move to 6.4 and use the (unmerged) PR as a blueprint, or merge and go from there in DSpace 7, can be decided soon</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:52:50 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> I do wish this code was in the API layer, but I won't block it for 6.3.  It's a "quick fix", but we should figure out a better place for 7.0</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:53:38 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> ok, and if we figure out a better place for 7.0 in a way that can be backported to a future 6.4 or 6.5 or something, we'd just revert the commits made in 2038 for 6.3?</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">3:54:27 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> Likely yes, but that question @kshepherd depends on whether the 7.0 "place" is somewhere that also exists in 6.x ;)  So, if in 7.0, this ends up at the (new) REST API, then it cannot be backported anyhow</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">3:54:59 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> ok, we'll note this in PR but not block for 6.3 so @pbecker, if it has your +1 as quick fix, we can still merge</span><br/>

<span class="irc-date">4:14:45 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> mhwood left the room (quit: Quit: Leaving.).</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">4:16:09 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <kshepherd> hrm , not sure where that's run from. is it normally realtime?</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">4:17:19 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <tdonohue> It normally is almost "realtime".  Looks like the bot crashed. I'll look into it, and perhaps manually copy the notes from here into today's date (it just generates flat HTML for each date)</span><br/>
<span class="irc-date">4:18:30 PM CDT</span> <span class="irc-black"> DSpaceSlackBot: <pbecker> thank you @tdonohue</span><br/>
