<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Welcome back, all!  I hope everyone had a good holiday and a happy new year.  I think we all deserved a bit of a break after the 1.7.0 release :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was happy to learn that I didn't miss two weeks' worth of meetings after all. :-/</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hi sandsfish &amp; richardrodgers -- doing a JIRA review right now... starting here: Page does not exist: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-641">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-641</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There isn't one *anywhere* now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; thanks tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, definitely not there now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, any volunteers to look into DS-641, and fix it (maybe for 1.7.1)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; there is error/....jsp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- yea, I'm assuming it should be pointing at *something* in error/, rather than at /browse/error.jsp (which doesn't exist anymore)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; no volunteers for DS-641?  Ok.  I'll schedule it for 1.7.1, and hopefully we can find someone to fix this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt;  IPAuthentication doesn't work with IPv6 addresses : <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-642">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-642</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; does this cause errors, or just that instantiating this class and not setting the error page doesn't work right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- don't know -- we'd need a volunteer to investigate and resolve DS-641</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Since I'm the local IPv6 enthusiast, maybe I should take 642.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sure, mhwood.  Sounds good to me!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Will do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Assign DS-642 to mhwood.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Enhanced embargo functionality : <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-645">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-645</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; no code available for DS-645.  Seems like it'd definitely have to wait for 1.8.0 at earliest (as it's an improvement).  Anyone interested in working on this, or have something already brewing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, will leave DS-645 unassigned for now.  Seems like a possible new feature, but would need a volunteer to investigate and look into potential implementation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; This is a worthy task to say the least.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We'll stop there for today with JIRA, as I'd like to move on to discussions of 1.7.0 and beyond :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First off, again, hope you all had a good break (I know I did) &amp; happy new year!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; happy new year all!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Likewise.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I basically wanted to open things up for discussion of the 1.7.0 release process.  What did we feel went well, what was problematic or harder than it should have been, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or any other feedback anyone has around 1.7.0 release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; maven</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; For the first time around in a time-based release, I'd say we did pretty well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Agreed.  I think we did well with the time-based release!  I'd like to see that continue :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- I also agree, Maven was a pain.  But we now have a new, solid Release Procedure that works well: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was wary of a fixed deadline -- I always am -- but it did go well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Do others think the idea of a "fixed deadline" is worth continuing?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; that's a great accomplishment tdonohue, and thanks to all who made it a reality.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; [cheers documented procedure]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks -- Mark Diggory started those docs, and I added tons of extra detail as I worked to fix the broken release process in the last few weeks.  It's now "solid" (or at least it worked perfectly for me, the few times I ran through it for an RC and the 1.7.0 final)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One area I like to mention that I think we need to improve on:  Documentation.    Unfortunately, most of those docs didn't "get in" or get cleaned up until the final day(s) before the release.  It gave Jeff Trimble &amp; I a few very hectic days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; One thing we might do differently next time - have a real beta period. We jumped straight to release candidates....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, we likely need to come up with a better Documentation process for the Wiki -- this was our first try, and it was a bit chaotic at the end.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The pain of the process was that not all things finished before the imposed deadline. So going forward, it would be better to have code developed in the open, so that everyone can see progress of features</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...but largely, most everything went smoothly, so i would recommend doing another timed release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If documentation is lagging, yell for help.  I'm definitely an enthusiast there too.  Main problem:  understanding the code well enough to document.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; richardrodgers, how do you see the beta-process as being different than say an "RC1"?  Is it just by name?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; tdonohue: not just name. What I have in mind is more like an 'early access' release, so adopters could really exercise stuff before it's cooked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; picking up on mhwood's comment - now that we have a larger run up on future releases, we should pick a month for the release, and set a 'soft' target for the start of that month. We can never truly account for issues found in testing, so having the potential (at least relatively early on) to slip the release by a week or two but still make the schedule would be useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood, thanks.  I think the bigger issue here was that we didn't have an organized "process" for making sure the docs were updated on the Wiki.  What essentially happened was that I happened to notice 2 days before the release that most of the new main features had no docs in our wiki docs area.  Cause a bit of scrambling to find the appropriate docs/people.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Perhaps richardrodgers and PeterDietz are saying the same thing in different ways?  A lot of code landed at the last minute, without much time for the community to comprehend it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmmm..yea, I understand now (and yea, I think richardrodgers &amp; PeterDietz have similar points)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; grahamtriggs: that's what we did with 1.7 actually.  We had a "soft target" of Dec 4th initially...but, after the RC1 release issues, we moved back to our "hard target" of Dec 17.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-green">* vhollister (48c88f7e@gateway/web/freenode/ip.72.200.143.126) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (maybe that wasn't clear though -- it was initially documented as a soft target of Dec 4 in the Release Notes though -- and Peter &amp; I talked around then and decided to push for Dec 17 instead)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; To me the difference between beta and RC is that in beta there's still time to reshape things, but an RC is pretty much set in stone except for bugfixes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; richardrodgers: practically, that just means we could/should have given a 'beta' tag to what was released as RC1. I think what's really interesting is how the psychology around this might work - are people more likely test a beta on the basis that it's a call to be tested, versus an RC where they might just think 'oh, it's nearly ready - I'll just wait for the release'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, going back to this idea of a "beta".  Would we see this as occurring 1-2 months before we start RC1?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; grahamtriggs: yes, there are interesting psych dimensions. With a beta, people expect they can shape it, or nudge it, a bit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think this idea of a beta is interesting one -- but obviously the begs the question of whether there will truly be enough time between beta and RC1 to allow for significant changes/testing to occur.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so to test out code thats not fully cooked, either have a demo instance running running 1.7.x.embargo-feature, or just have an easy to follow recipe for installing your work-in-progress</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I believe if we can make releasing lightweight enough, we could have several (distinct) betas, e.g.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How about this:  each impending feature "goes beta" when preliminary code lands in the common repo.  We are encouraged to expose new code as soon as it's somewhat functional.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- interesting thought.. you and richardrodgers are both suggesting something akin to an "agile development" process (though for betas) -- more betas in shorter periods</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I have a Dilbert cartoon right here about Agile development.  But I guess basically I'm saying that beta starts as soon as something new (not a bugfix) lands, and continues until features are frozen and RC begins.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So,  I wonder if we'd truly get much community-wide testing in any *one* beta period (unless of course, it was a major feature most were highly interested in).   Though, it does have the potential to try to get more folks involved earlier on (at least for major features)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I don't think that is going to particularly work - if the betas are too frequent you risk people ignoring them because they can't keep up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* alxp (~alxp@PC044.ROBLIB.UPEI.CA) Quit (Quit: alxp)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hmm, but would the alpha/beta to test be a not-fully-cooked work in progress. I'm beating a dead horse, but I think a DVCS makes this easier for the developers to checkout each others code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; A regular *deployment* that people can dip in and out of using to see what the current state of the code is would be useful, and is independent of having beta 'releases'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not to be pessimistic :)  but, I'd also point out we all (self included) have a track record of getting things into Trunk at the latest possible moment (1.7 isn't the first time this has happened).   Do we feel a beta or perhaps several "stages" (where we just set a "beta1", "beta2" deadline) would encourage everyone to share code earlier?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; grahamtriggs: OK - but we still have to deal with the fact that trunk will at many times be unstable/incomplete...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or is something like PeterDietz's DVCS idea worth thinking about more in this context? (reminder to self: we need a special topics meeting on DVCS / git for deeper discussion)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Trunk being incomplete between releases is normal.  Unstable is exactly what we want to hear about and fix.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood +1  (also we have Bamboo to help catch the bigger instability problems -- and ensure our current, and future, tests aren't failing)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The problem, of course, is that people get the idea that DSpace is flaky.  Unfinished code *is* flaky.  How to set expectations?  How to pick relatively un-flaky revisions from time to time and present them to a wider (but still experimentally-minded) audience?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- one way is to actually set "intervals" (from agile development).  Essentially, you set "mini-deadlines" before the big ones.  So, we could do deadlines for "beta1", "beta2", "RC1", "RC2", "Final" spaced out over a period of time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; essentially then, you schedule different features for different "intervals"/deadlines.  Features #1 &amp; 2 will be in "beta1", a few more in "beta2", etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood wonders if some auto-deployer gizmo can be set to watch for new SCM tags in a given branch.  We reach agreement that rev. X is fairly stable, tag it, it replaces the previous semi-stable demo.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I'll stick my neck on the line - I don't think DVCS makes a huge difference in those terms. It still comes down to a differentiation between code that is shared and code that is local. Sure, having a local versioning of your developments before you share them is useful. Otherwise, a DVCS may be better for synchronizing and branching, but that's really an issue of the quality of the tool, not tied to it's philosop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well -- sounds like we still have a lot of ideas floating around here :)  The general consensus seems to be that we'd like to (1) share code earlier, (2) get feedback/testing earlier, and (3) preferably get that feedback well before RC1, so that a feature has time to morph/change.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DVCS can, though, insert a new layer of sharing between unshared and common.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; tdonohue: sounds that way to me too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; mhwood: so can SVN - it's called a branch. But merging and synchronizing code in svn is more complicated than would make it truly useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Is there any other feedback on this?  Obviously, we need to figure out the best way to *accomplish* these goals (several ideas already came up: one or more betas, DVCS, agile practices).  We'll keep thinking about this / discussing it so we can figure out what we want to try for 1.8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Technology can help, but in the end, getting code out early/often is something that developers do.  I need to get better at that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; agreed mhwood :) me too!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd also remind everyone that already we do have places to share early/incomplete code in our SVN.  Mainly in both the 'modules' and 'sandbox' areas.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; modules: <a href="http://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/">http://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/</a>     and sandbox: <a href="http://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/sandbox/">http://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/sandbox/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I know those aren't always the most ideal ways to share code earlier -- but, wanted to remind everyone of them)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's what we have for now and I think we should start by making the best use of what we have.  Things like DVCS are another topic, though perhaps with applications to this one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Once we have the conventions and habits established, we can talk about technology to support them better.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One last topic/announcement:  1.7.1 &amp; 1.8.0.  We still need one or more volunteers to be the 1.7.1 and/or 1.8.0 Release Coordinator!  So, if you are interested (or potentially interested), let me know.  (I'm anticipating we'll probably have a 1.7.1, since we've never not had an X.X.1 release)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; On which point, have we heard of any real 1.7.0 nasties yet?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not to my knowledge.  The worst I've heard is that 1.7.0 actually needs Maven 2.2.x or above to build  (the docs actually wrongly said 2.0.8 or above)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone try a 1.7.0 upgrade locally yet, or notice anything else?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ..i'll take that as a "No, Tim, we haven't started our upgrade yet" :)</span><br />

Let me know if you are interested in being the next Release Coordinator (or even co-Coordinator)!  Also, let Val or I know if/when you are upgraded to 1.7 (or know of someone).  We want to announce/highlight some of the earlier adopters</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We'd like to try the new Mirage theme as a basis for upgrading a repo. from 1.5.x, but it's still just planning.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: yea. It's still up for discussion, but I'd imagine that 1.8 would likely be a similar schedule, and within 9-12mos after 1.7.0.  But, once a final decision is made, we'll announce it on the lists</span><br />
