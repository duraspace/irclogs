<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so we have a (small) handful of folks here. Was hoping for more, but it seems July is full of vacations :)  We've had very sparse meetings this month, but hey..everyone deserves time away</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Dylan&gt; Indeed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Obviously, the hot topic this week continues to be 6.0.  Progress has slowed in recent weeks (cause of vacations it seems, or folks too busy to chip in)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This list of 30 has fewer and fewer that need "volunteers" (there are some though).  More and more are moving towards "Need Code Review" or "Need Documentation" status... so, we are getting closer, but we seem to need more testers / documenters</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Sidenote... Dylan, since you are here, a friendly reminder that DS-3086 still needs docs from you or Tom Desair</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in terms of raw numbers, roughly 1/2 of our tickets are in the "Needs Code Review" status.

<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-green">* pbecker (~pbecker@ubwstmapc098.ub.tu-berlin.de) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: actually, looking again, 1472 *is* at +2  (myself and helix84)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh, missed that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi pbecker, welcome :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, mhwood, I think 1472 can be merged.  The only concerns left there have been opened into a separate ticket (as they are only "loosely" related)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The separate ticket is DS-3277, which also might be worth touching on today (as it's a pretty significant issue, I believe)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3277">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3277</a> ] - [DS-3277] Change in behavior: Handles are now minted based on `handle_id` internal table ID - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Aha, I tracked down the target of that broken link to the Oracle helper script.  I'll fix that and then merge?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good to me, mhwood. 1472 fixes what it set out to fix</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, it shall be done.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, 3277 is serious.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As for 3277.  I'm pretty sure I have a possible fix to revert back to minting handles off of the "handle_seq" directly...and not based on "handle_id" (which really has no guarantee the next value is an available handle)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I don't have a PR (yet), but might have something later today.  I'm basically using Hibernate to query "handle_seq" for the next value... and disconnecting the sequence from "handle_id".  This seems to render "handle_id" useless, which may mean it could also be removed (but I haven't gotten that far yet)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We have a few other "manual" uses of sequences in DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If "handle_id" is found to be useless, it likely could be dropped...and the Primary Key could be moved over to the "handle" column</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Which makes sense, since handle.handle must be *universally* unique anyway.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: do you recall where those other "manual" uses of sequences are? I admit, I looked for them, and couldn't find them (maybe I was searching for the wrong thing).  I ended up writing my own method (untested as of yet though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; No, I don't recall.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: ok, well if you stumble back on them, pass them my way.  I'll try some more digging around post-mtg just in case</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Will do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, 3277 is in progress. I'll need feedback &amp; testers (obviously) once I get a PR ready to go.  I'm trying to avoid changing too much (this late in the game) in order to ensure I don't accidentally break something else.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will note though that, for anyone who can help chip in on testing, there are several other *significant* fixes that are just waiting around for a test (and have been waiting now for several weeks)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-green">* luizsan (~luizsan@209.120.171.227) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Two that I'd like to highlight are DSPR#1468 and DSPR#1471  (Fixes to Flyway setup, Ant Migrations, and how XML Workflow is enabled)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've done a large amount of testing (locally) of these two related PRs.  the second PR (1471) is actually built from the first PR's branch (1468), so you can test them both by simply testing off of 1471.   But, these need more eyes/testers (Committers or non-Committers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Dylan...not sure if you'd know of anyone from Atmire would be willing/able to help test one (or both of these), since I'm changing the XML / Configurable Workflow setup slightly (in 1471)?  (Normally, I'd ask this question of Kevin, but he's on vacation)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Dylan&gt; Unfortunately, this is best suited for Kevin, but I will post it to some devs here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've put those on my to-test list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks Dylan. Yes, I figured this is best for Kevin as well. I'll also try and give him a friendly reminder once he gets back (though I know he'll have plenty to catch up on!) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks mhwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Dylan&gt; Yeah he probably will, and no problem :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; huh, offhand, I do not. Searching around a bit, doesn't give any great clues either (yet)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Wondering outloud if we should look at the dependencies that require that, and see if any were recently "upgraded"...maybe there's a way to track down "what changed"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sometime after we get 6.0 out the door, we need to spend some time on XOAI, processing tickets/PRs and especially cleaning up its nest of backlevel dependencies, which DSpace is currently addressing with an ever-growing list of exclusions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yeah, I was wondering if backing out a dependency upgrade would be the smoothest path (for now).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yes, that's my thought now.  Trying to figure out what dependency upgrade is problematic to XOAI/OAI.  It might all be related to DS-3016 (or a subticket of that) where a bunch of dependencies were upgraded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3016">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-3016</a> ] - [DS-3016] upgrade dependencies before 6.0 release - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thanks, I'll look into that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (note: The subtickets of 3016 actually show which upgrades were implemented)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If you make any further headway or want to bounce ideas around, let me know.  Glad to do so on 3270.  I'll probably be concentrating most immediately though on fixing the Handle issues myself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, thanks.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker, I'm curious if you are able to chip in on testing some of these PRs? (no pressure though..I know you are just getting back recently) I'm just wondering what your schedule is looking like in coming weeks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; sorry, I cannot promise anything currently.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Oh, and as a friendly reminder, pbecker, we could especially use your feedback on DSPR#1399 whenever you get the chance...it's nearly ready to go)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I still have some PRs to test and to write documentation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I know, sorry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: ok, makes sense.  Yes, definitely feel free to concentrate first on the things you volunteered for, etc ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and I completely understand if your schedule is crazy over the summer. Just wanted to touch base</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I know. :-) I would love to do more, but there are to many local projects starting right now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; (local = TU Berlin)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: understood :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* Dylan (~Dylan@86.39.200.115.static.hosted.by.easyhost.be) Quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If there are others here willing to help us test/validate PRs, we really could use more help (as you can tell, Committers are a bit busy with other things or on vacation).   It's a good way to start to get more involved in the overall approval process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I also did recent add hints/tips on testing individual PRs to our Git notes: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Development+with+Git#DevelopmentwithGit-TestingPullRequests">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Development+with+Git#DevelopmentwithGit-TestingPullRequests</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks like DSPR#1399 is +1 (1 inspection, 1 tester).</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yes 1399 is also waiting for pbecker a bit. He had good feedback on that early on.. I'm *pretty sure* all his concerns have been met, but I'd like to have him give it a quick review (if possible)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; If a review is sufficient I'll do that tomorrow early in the morning. But others would have to chip in for tests.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: I think it could be sufficient to do a code review &amp; perhaps list out things you feel *need re-testing*.  It might help others to chip in on the tests themselves (and get this off your plate)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; will do, thanks.</span><br />
