<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; &lt;here&gt;: Hello, and welcome. It's time for our weekly DSpace DevMtg.  Agenda linked above :point_up:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Let's do a quick roll call to see who's here today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so at least there's 3 of us :slightly_smiling_face:  I'm realizing more and more that these "late" meetings (at 20UTC) seem more sparsely attended (by only folks in North America...though I know it's late in Europe)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Initially the goal here was to catch different parts of the world by two separate times...but, recently, seems we are less successful at that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, something for us to consider...do we "standardize" on 15UTC, if that time really works better for "most everyone" these days.  We don't need to answer now, but just a trend I'm noticing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; It seems like the time could work for Andrea S and Kim, but they have not joined in a while.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, initially 20UTC was mostly for those two...as it is early morning for them in NZ / Aus</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Exactly.  The later meeting was a wee bit early for the western Pacific and AU/NZ, while the early one is deep nighttime.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Right...just noticing that nearly all of our activity/attendance right now is coming out of North America and Europe...so, this 20UTC mtg ends up working against us slightly.  It's a "good idea" conceptually, but seems to not be working out (recently) in practice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Maybe I'll just mention this on -devel  / -commit and note I'm considering standardizing meetings at 15UTC (at least for the near future) unless anyone objects.  We can always reintroduce 20UTC again at a later time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, we can move along to the actual agenda</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; That makes sense to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I don't have anything to really announce/update on DSpace 7.  Though the Development Status spreadsheet is now further along / more accurate: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18brPF7cZy_UKyj97Ta44UJg5Z8OwJGi7PLoPJVz-g3g/edit#gid=0">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18brPF7cZy_UKyj97Ta44UJg5Z8OwJGi7PLoPJVz-g3g/edit#gid=0</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; More on DSpace 7 though in tomorrow's meeting at 15UTC (obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Fyi, I will be on vaction tomorrow, so I will miss that call</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; There was a meeting of the DSpace 7 Outreach Group ( outreach ) today.  It was a brief meeting, we reviewed that DSpace 7 Dev spreadsheet.  We also briefly discussed the work-in-progress, high level overview of "What's in DSpace": <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5f9FE-V3eQDYnKc1b7wOv5thT143oTdUGtf-Vqk7Gw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5f9FE-V3eQDYnKc1b7wOv5thT143oTdUGtf-Vqk7Gw/edit</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I will post a status update to reht rest channel</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; I missed the roll call, but I'm lurking today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Whatâ€™s in DSpace 7 - Google Docs ] - <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5f9FE-V3eQDYnKc1b7wOv5thT143oTdUGtf-Vqk7Gw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M5f9FE-V3eQDYnKc1b7wOv5thT143oTdUGtf-Vqk7Gw/edit</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; While folks are welcome to review the "What's in DSpace" doc...it's still WIP, and yet to be reviewed by DCAT (which will be the next step in coming weeks).  So, it's mostly an FYI of other activities</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that's really it on DSpace 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, and The DSpace Entities Group ( entities-wg ) just announced the next mtg will be Feb 23 at 15UTC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Based on the last update from the Entities Group, I think our Digital Services Librarian will start attending those calls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Next up... DSpace 6.3.  No updates to share. It still needs an "owner" / coordinator. We still have some bugs being reported / analyzed. Nothing seems super-serious (though there are annoying bugs as always), so it seems like no one is in a rush to get 6.3 out yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I will make my weekly plea for testing for my PR's: <a href="https://github.com/terrywbrady/restReportTutorial/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/terrywbrady/restReportTutorial/blob/master/README.md</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think that's it for 6.3 as well...unless anyone else has something to say on that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; In DSpace 5, there was no Shibb auth in the REST api, so I had to work around that limitation (and bypass authentication).  The latest PR integrates Shibb auth into the reporting tools.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Next up, I had slotted in brainstorms from @terrywbrady on a possible Virtual Dev Conference: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/~terrywbrady/Virtual+DSpace+Developer+Conference">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/~terrywbrady/Virtual+DSpace+Developer+Conference</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Virtual DSpace Developer Conference - Terry Brady - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/~terrywbrady/Virtual+DSpace+Developer+Conference">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/~terrywbrady/Virtual+DSpace+Developer+Conference</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: yes, thanks for your work on getting Shibb integrated...and all the work on reporting tools</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Last week, I was feeling like an old developer: I was trying use a new IDE, a new testing framework, and looking at some code with lamdas embedded and I realized that I could use some tips from other develoeprs.  That was what prompted my idea for a developer conference.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; And, I would still love to know how to spin up a cloud instance of DSpace at a low cost.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, I like the idea of "sharing what we do / how we do things", assuming we can get folks wanting to do the sharing piece! ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; I won't have much to contribute in the way of shiny new tools and techniques, since I am rather conservative about tooling....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Perhaps we could schedule something from 1400UTC-1700UTC.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; count me in, I can show off Vagrant-DSpace as well as a Docker-based environment I've been using lately</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll admit, I feel less like a developer these days (rarely get to actually touch code), so my dev environment is a bit chaotic at times.  But, I'm starting to learn IntelliJ... I have knowledge of vagrant-dspace (and use it on occasion).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd gladly participate though, and share what I can.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I think @tom_desair would have a lot to teach us all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd like to see the Docker stuff (from @hpottinger).  I'd also generally be interested to hear/see how others develop on DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; <a href="https://github.com/dspace-labs/dspace-dev-docker">https://github.com/dspace-labs/dspace-dev-docker</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ GitHub - DSpace-Labs/dspace-dev-docker: DSpace instant development environment using Docker ] - <a href="https://github.com/dspace-labs/dspace-dev-docker">https://github.com/dspace-labs/dspace-dev-docker</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; What's often missing in talk about new gadgets is "why is this better?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I have used Eclipse for nearly 20 years.  I don't know how to tell it to make sense of all of the Spring stuff in DSpace 7.  This is driving me to look elsewhere.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; heh, I'm happy to talk about how Docker is significantly faster than Vagrant :slightly_smiling_face:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: Yes, I've been (slowly) trying to move to IntelliJ cause of similar frustrations in NetBeans recently (and oft hearing about how IntelliJ does much more).  So, I'm in a similar boat to some extent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think the gap here in "making this happen" is finding a free "couple hours", and finding a few folks willing to put there name down as a "presenter" (which can be as loosely defined as we want -- maybe even just talking 10 mins about how you do dev, optionally screenshare, and talk about what you'd like to learn more about)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Really?  I have Spring plugins in NetBeans that do everything I've wanted so far.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; @mwood, you have more to share than you think!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Or I haven't wanted much yet....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @mwood: Part of the frustrations from me also stem from DSpace 7 efforts...and finding that IntelliJ also works with Angular / TypeScript.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Would a few short meetings be better than planning a "conference"?  Per haps a developer show and tell.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, I think we should start with a few short meetings. If it grows, it can turn into a "conference"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; monthly?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Yeah, maybe to get started we just need a few people to say, "this is how I normally work -- is it barmy or brilliant?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; funny thing about "normal"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I will post something to a wiki page and to dspace-dev to find some interested parties.  We can schedule from there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Honestly, I say we just schedule 1-2 meetings. See what happens. If it's useful, it can become a "monthly" thing (or whatever timelines we like)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks @terrywbrady. That sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Doodle poll the time?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Any suggestions for a name for the meeting?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; hi all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to Doodle poll.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Hi @kshepherd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Aside:  I think Doodle is one of the few "new" gadgets that really are improvements.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; Action: hpottinger waves to kshepherd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Hey, lookie there! It's @kshepherd.  I've heard of that guy ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; heh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; just reading up re: meeting times</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; i haven't been around in a while because i'm technically still on holiday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh. Didn't realize (and thanks for popping in to give feedback)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; but i also understand that if it's inconvenient to everyone else, having a whole set of meetings in a 'far east' friendly timezone just for 2 people that aren't always around, might not make heaps of sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; to be honest i thought it was for UK people... the 20:00 GMT thing was already around before i was a committer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; (and just happened to work out for me too)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; The origin of 20UTC escapes me exactly...I think it mostly came about cause it worked better for "several folks at the time"....and yes, I don't think it was just you &amp; Andrea S</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; well i'm ok with 15UTC if it makes life easier for y'all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; i can occasionally try to stay / wake up at 3am</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm just starting to question it myself, cause it seems like 20UTC meetings are just USA folks (very specifically, @hpottinger, @mwood, @terrywbrady and I)... while 15UTC tends to be more well attended by Europeans (and other lurkers)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; It was a compromise that seemed to work:  mid-evening for Europe/Africa, late in the workday for the Americas, and not unconscionably early for NZ.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; <a href="http://irclogs.duraspace.org/">http://irclogs.duraspace.org/</a> contains a vast collection of text, ready for mining</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @kshepherd: I'd hate to have you wake up in the middle of the night.  Honestly, I think it's a question of "do you feel you'd like to regularly attend again"?  If it's never gonna happen in the near future, then we might as well move entirely to 15UTC (and you can keep in the loop via email, Slack, etc).... But, if there are folks who would like a 20UTC and would attend them, I'm all for keeping two times.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I also do still plan to bring this to the lists. Honestly, I still like the idea of two separate times, but I'm finding it harder and harder to argue for, if one of the two is always sparsely attended.   Ideally though, we simply get attendance "up" for both ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; How does this look?  <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Developer+Show+and+Tell+Meetings">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Developer+Show+and+Tell+Meetings</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace Developer Show and Tell Meetings - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Developer+Show+and+Tell+Meetings">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Developer+Show+and+Tell+Meetings</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: I like it.  It's nice and simple, too the point.  We'll see how it goes, and optionally it can expand into a full "conference" or "summit" of sorts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; sorry, my connection keeps going down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; i'd like to come to more meetings - i'm doing a lot more dspace work this year than last so should be more active generally, but if my commitment to come to meetings is the only reason for 20UTC, i'd feel bad if i could not make it for some reason</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; so... i probably won't argue for a 20UTC if others are finding it inconvenient (i didn't realise it was the inconvenient / sparsely attended one, but then again i have no frame of reference since i'm never awake for the other one ;))</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Neither have amazing attendance these days...but we tend to get at least 3-4 more people at 15UTC most weeks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; It's good to hear though that you plan to get involved again, @kshepherd.  That's great news</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; 20 UTC is 15 EST, so it's quite convenient for me.  I feel guilty that both times are during my normal workday.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; The only reason both times are in your workday, @mwood is that I'm the meeting convenier/organizer (so the times need to be in my workday)...and we are just hours apart (drive-wise)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; :slightly_smiling_face:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think from this discussion it'd probably be best to bring this to the -devel and -commit mailing lists.  I'd much much rather find *two times* of interest to (different sets of) attendees and get both meeting attendance increased.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, we'll see if we can drum up more interest in meetings at a time separate from 15UTC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; If you post a question to the lists about the meeting time, it might be worthwhile to ask for feedback on why folks do not attend to see if something else could be done to boost attendance.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; As we only have about 10mins left, I wonder if there's anything else folks here would like to specifically discuss?  (The remainder of the agenda is just a list of tickets that might "be of interest" to others)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; It is a huge relieve to only have a 1 hour block rather than the 2 hour blocks we used to have with the jira review</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; another option: if there's interest from, say, south/east/SE asia, pacific, etc (the funny timezones!) for some smaller meetings at a totally different time (eg 0200 UTC), i dont mind volunteering to run those meetings since they'll be in a very unfriendly time for EU and probably US as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @kshepherd: I think that's a great idea (assuming we can find folks interested in a "totally different time").  I definitely wouldn't be able to make it (2am for me), but I'd catch up later for sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; That is 6pm for me, so I could make a guest appearance from time to time.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Wait. That's not 2am ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; That's 8pm for me. I might be able to "lurk" on occasion...but may not make the whole meeting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, I'm all for meetings at any time... they just need interested attendees and a convenier.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; would be great to be able to get some discussion going with devs from japan, india, china, australia, nz, etc... if we can find people who want to of course :slightly_smiling_face: i have a feeling there are more dspace users out there than we hear from often ;)  (see: fb group vs mailing list posts)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, maybe I can turn this question to lists into a :  What do you want to see out of Dev Meetings?  What time(s) would you be interested in attending?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; (Starting to sound more like a short survey of sorts)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, noticing we are nearing the end of this meeting. Any final comments / words of wisdom / requests for help that anyone wants to share?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Keep looking over the PRs please?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; anybody want a release 6.3?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, we do need more PR reviews (both for 6.3 and 7.0 stuff). And, yes we need a 6.3 Release coordinator.  Thanks for both</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I am posting a blurb about the show and tell meetings.  Can you offer guidance on using "here" vs "channel" in Slack?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we'll go ahead and close things up for today. I'll be lurking around for a few more hours if you need me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I don't want to spam folks, but I want the message to be seen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady:  The "here" pings folks who are currently active.  The "channel" pings *everyone* in the channel (active or not).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Is it rude to "channel"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; It's rude to overuse "channel". But, in this situation, if you are on dev specifically, it seems reasonable to "channel" it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot2&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; No problem!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:02]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* mhwood (~mhwood@mhw.ulib.iupui.edu) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:40]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* tdonohue (~tdonohue@dspace/tdonohue) Quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)</span><br />
