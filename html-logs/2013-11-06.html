<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Unfortunately, the DuraSpace wiki just crashed...so, I cannot link to the agenda</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The main topic for today is obviously DSpace 4.0 and the Testathon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There were some specific JIRA tickets logged recently that I wanted to be sure we looked at and discussed today (but others are free to add more)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: I only noted that someone other has fixed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, I meant thanks for letting me know the wiki is back :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 1749:  there seems to be some confusion about whether Lucene indexing is still supported.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; hi everyone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; DS-1749 hide also a bug in the current installation process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1749">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1749</a> ] - [DS-1749] Graceful deprecation for different index update launcher commands - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; looking to <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/src/main/config/build.xml#L949">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/src/main/config/build.xml#L949</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace/dspace/src/main/config/build.xml at master · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/src/main/config/build.xml#L949">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/src/main/config/build.xml#L949</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I actually have a comment on 1749 I haven't had time to write up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we are still running DSIndexer during the installation process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, regarding Ds-1749, it seems like we have a few options here... (1) we change the default "dspace index" to point at Discovery instead of Lucene, or (2) we change all our docs to tell people to no longer user "dspace index" unless they are using Lucene</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I think renaming the update-discovery-index to index-init/index-update is a really bad idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: that's a good point. Definite bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; it will lead to much confusion and questions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; as it is now, it's easy to explain which command uses which backend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84_ : I actually worry the other route will cause too much confusion.  In all our docs (all over the place) we have mentiosn of "dspace index"...and if we don't find all mentions and change them, people will report errors</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Add a warning:  "Solr index is default -- are you sure?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; but if we start mixing commands and dspace versions... I really don't want to answer those questions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I agree with Ivan... probably we should remove the DSIndexer from the auto-running script in fresh_install and change the documentation to say what script they need to run. mhwood: good suggestion too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Indeed, the old commands should continue to do what they have done until they are no longer supported.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; tdonohue: I'll be happy to fix the docs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well, the other route is to not let *anything* use "dspace index".   All commands are changed to "dspace index-lucene" or "dspace index-solr" and "dspace index" just reports that you need to use the other commands</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; mhwood: where should that warning appear?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 mhwood, +1 backwards compatibility, especially where cron jobs are involved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; When you run "dspace index" it can remind you that perhaps you no longer want to do that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; tdonohue: it's a false choice. the third way is to let the commands do what they do now and educate the users</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; mhwood,,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Idea off the top of my head:  "dspace index --lucene", "dspace index --solr".  I have no idea yet whether this is good or bad.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; my problem is that (in my mind) "dspace index" should re-index DSpace (as the command implies). If "dspace index" now just throws errors by default, how does that help?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Can the command look at the config. to see which it should do? or, at least, definitely say "this won't work"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree I'd love to have "backwards compatibility"...but if by default it throws errors, that's also not backwards compatibility</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; ok, actually - and I hope you believe me when I say that - "dspace index" is not discussed all that much _on the lists_. we usually deal with index-init/index-update and update-discovery index.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I like that conceptually...just not sure how to do that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: so simple so good!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I don't have a strong opinion on what "dspace index" should do, only that the other three should continue to do what they do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; and that wouldn't throw any errors</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; why not look to the configuration as mhwood propose and just do the right work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; but it would update an index that is not used by default (a situation we've had since 1.8)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; so I suggest to add a text to each of those commands to say which index it's updating</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; that's wrong, helix84_.   In a default installation of DSpace 4.0, "dspace index-init" and "dspace index-update" will throw errors.  See DS-1762</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1762">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1762</a> ] - [DS-1762] When run command &amp;quot;dspace index-init&amp;quot; - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; tdonohue: I see, that's because of ItemCounterDAOSolr.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I like mhwood's idea to see if we can change "index", "index-init" and "index-update" to be "smart" and index based on configs.. just not sure how hard that'd be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; discovery/lucene is easy to individuate for jspui but hard for xmlui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; first problem there is - AFAIK there's no _single_ config property that changes which index is used</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the browse init should can always run  (just do nothing with solr)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the ItemCounter is needed if we use cache <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/config/dspace.cfg#L972">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/config/dspace.cfg#L972</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace/dspace/config/dspace.cfg at master · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/config/dspace.cfg#L972">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/config/dspace.cfg#L972</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84_ : IIRC, mhwood had a way of telling whether Discovery or Lucene is enabled in the new "./dspace version" command... looking for it now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; can't you have both indexes at the same time? Its just a config change to switch discovery-ui on/off. I would say to leave the commands be explicity (un-smart), and have the repo administrator type in which index they are updating</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; here it is..he's parsing the "enabled" event consumers: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/util/Version.java#L61">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/util/Version.java#L61</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/util/Version.java at master · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/util/Version.java#L61">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/util/Version.java#L61</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thanks, I had forgotten.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we can have both index in use... one from an UI one from the other</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; this is what we have done in the demo site until dspace 3</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Thus, I guess lucene-index-update becomes new, and index-update gets deprecated/killed, and discovery-index-update stays.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; just note that, I don't recommend that...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, each type of index manipulator could look at the config. and see whether it is enabled.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; As Peter and Andrea pointed out, it's not so simple. Moreover, the consumer is not the only option that decides.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: I'm ok with that. But it's misleading that Lucene indexing is generically named ("index", "index-init", "index-update"), while the default Discovery indexing is oddly named ("update-discovery-index").  It seems like they both should say what index they work against</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, I see PeterDietz just said the same thing by suggestiong "update-lucene-index" or similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; it's a good idea, let's just make the naming consistent - update-lucene-index</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; tdonohue:  yes, we should destroy the specific commands and just have "index", which can be told which you mean and can discover whether it should refuse to run on that index.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd rather this all be "./dspace index --lucene" and "./dspace index --discovery", which is what mhwood seems to be saying...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK, if we destroy the old commands, we need to document the changes in the upgrade docs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, that's what I'm saying.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; if we want to have any sort of smart decisionmaking, we need to sort 2 things out: 1) single config option for turning on discovery 2) what if someone wants to use both indexes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm still thinking that it will be nice to have dspace index to do the right job without user prompt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; dspace index need to run all the needed scripts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There are two different pieces of indexing:  (1) which indexing service(s) you feed, and (2) which one you use in a UI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; so we just need to list all the scripts and found a parameter that say if we need to run it or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; "./dspace index" could just "do the right thing" by checking to see if you have Discovery or Lucene enabled.  But, you can specifically run "./dspace index --lucene" and "./dspace index --discovery" to force a specific indexing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; tdonohue: that would be logical if we had a single option. see mhwood's comment.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84_ sorry, I misstated...I meant this:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, DTRT could mean "init/update/whatever all the services that are enabled".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ./dspace index   -&gt; Would index Discovery or Lucene (OR BOTH) depending on config settings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; wait I think that we are doing confusion here</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Good point.  People already have habits related to "index" too.  Ugh.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I think we should write down all the options and problems to help us decide</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; rushing this will only lead to confusion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; for example, I'd like to take the time to review all config options related to indexing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, anyone want to jot down the various options on a wiki page or something for us to work from?  We just need to get this moving forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I'll do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think we need to be wary of taking decision-making from repository admins, making scripts "smart" takes control away, even if it's appealing, we can't assume we can program a perfect AI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I'll send it to -commiters for comments</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84_: you win a beer :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: I agree. My opinion is it's ok to be "smart" by default. But we need to allow folks to specify exactly what they want to override those defaults</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We don't need an AI to work with existing knowledge.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Where we get into trouble is in assuming more knowledge than we actually have.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; smart defaults with the ability to override I'm OK with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I think nobody disagrees with that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; other way we get into trouble is if the environment in which the "smarts" exists changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sure:  if you tell it which one, it does that one or says "I can't".  If you don't choose, it does all configured options.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: for example we are assuming that consumers are always used...but someone could decide to do index only in batch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, this is what is kinda in my head: <a href="https://gist.github.com/tdonohue/7343600">https://gist.github.com/tdonohue/7343600</a>   But, as helix84_ says, we should figure out what all options are out there, to see what we need exactly</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; let's move on and leave this for -commit or for next DevMtg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Is there some way to talk to each indexing service, which never blows up, and which will tell us whether it is being used?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; mhwood: we could check whether the index exists and is non-empty</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We probably should move along here...we've spent a lot of time on this one issue (though it is an important one)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; mhwood: but that still doesn't help with the option that both are being used</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84_: the first time that you install dspace indexes are empty</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's the sort of thing I was thinking.  But you're right, we should move on and resume discussion on the ML.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; You ask each service.  All that can be used, are used.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The big question on 1483 is:  Is this considered a "bug"?   I tend to think it is...cause Google Scholar is telling us it's not as good as it could be.  But, we need to decide whether to let this into 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and whether we agree with aschweer's approach)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's behavior specifically for Google Scholar, so changing the meaning shouldn't bother anyone else.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: correct</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I think it's a bug (because it causes issues for Scholar). I think Andrea's fix is reasonable.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; From Andrea's email, it sounds like Google has changed their definition of a PDF, and they are no longer limiting it to just application/pdf things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we have only a conceptual problem here.... primary bitstream was used to manage html content</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Does anyone have time to try and run some tests against Andrea's code?  I did a code review...but I haven't tested it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; i.e. link us to your text, doc, jpg, etc...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, it sounds like it never did what they wanted, but they have now better understood what they wanted?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: Google Scholar told us their change in policy regarding "citation_pdf_url" .  See the description in DS-1483 ticket</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1483">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1483</a> ] - [DS-1483] Store link to &amp;quot;primary bitstream&amp;quot; in citation_pdf_url for Google Scholar (request from Google) - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anurag (The lead at Google Scholar) specifically told me that "citation_pdf_url" NEED NOT BE A PDF.   It was initially assumed to be a PDF, but it's since changed to mean "the most important document to index"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we should clarify that primary bitstream is the "most important bitstream", what we link for google but we should also introduce a boolean flag that say show this bitstream in the bitstream list entry</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Where there *is* a "most important" document....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: yes, we would need to clarify the meaning of "primary bitstream".  Or, the other option is to instead use the bitstream ordering feature, and link the *1st* bitstream in "citation_pdf_url"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; use the ordering is not a good idea in my opinion... the google need will impose you a specific "order presentation"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; bollini, I agree.  That overloading is worrisome.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, just mentioned it as another option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so it sounds like using "primary bitstream" is OK with everyone, assuming we document that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; imho use the primary bitstream is the right way. Only want to note (also for dspace 5 not necessary for dspace 4) that a visibility flag on the bitstream could be a nice addition and will complete the requirements</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; ok, a note here - we're trying to cram multiple meanings into a few knobs,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Item 1234/5678:  Journal of Chemical Solubilities vol III.  Bitstreams:  issue 1, issue 2....  Order sometimes doesn't tell you what GS wants to know.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; suppose we do metadata on all objects (incl. bitstreams) - we could have one property for each purpose</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; there would be no need to mix the meaning of primary bitstream/bitstream order/bitstream for Scholar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; What does "primary" mean, in the absence of Google Scholar?  Because what GS wants, means:  "if a search engine would only find *one* of the bitstreams, which one do you want it to find?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; BTW this visibility flag on the bitstream looks like the discoverable flag on the item...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, but since we don't have "metadata for all objects" (yet), I guess the question is...is aschweer's PR a "good enough" solution for now?  Or would we rather keep the current (very limited) logic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; aschweer's code seems to be a step in the right direction.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; tdonohue: right, for now I agree that the patch improves the current situation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; There is a point that it is better the punt, and leave the dealing with minute details up to the end-repository.. This adds support for a wider net of content-type, and picking a "primary" out of a crowd of bitstreams. Two scenarios that were punted on previously</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that being said, would someone like to help test aschweer's work?  It seems like something we should work to merge soon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: We only had a narrow-net of content type before because Google Scholar initially said it was only for PDFs. Google Scholar has now changed their policies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; *mumble, we need a scripting language for expressing GS policies*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it would seem odd to continue to limit "citation_pdf_url" to PDFs only, when we created it for Google Scholar, and they are now telling us it should link to any content type</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hi aschweer: we're discussion your PR for DS-1483.  It sounds like it has approval, but needs others to test</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yes, testing would be great. abollini, the "bs must be public" one is a component of my logic I'm not sure about, it works for "my" repos but maybe not for others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And I think hpottinger said he would do that testing.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'll vote after I test, but +3 sounds like "good to merge" unless there's a veto</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aschweer: I had reviewed the wording of the "Advanced Embargo" form (when I tested &amp; merged it). It seemed OK. But, I hadn't looked as closely at the Simple Embargo form yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah the wording on the advanced form is fine, but the wording is being reused by the simple form in a way I didn't expect</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, I see. I didn't realize that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; me neither...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree, it seems reasonable to have the "simple embargo" be default.  But, we should fix it's wording obviously :)   Perhaps that's another ticket to add?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, I realize we are "over time" at this point. But, I did want to see if there's anything else pressing for 4.0?  Anything else folks noticing in Testathon that needs immediate attention/eyes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; has anyone had a look at the wording for the request item functionality? that one is likely to get lots of attention and a lot of the wording isn't suitable for production use right now</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; thanks tdonohue, was just looking for it in jira</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I reviewed the Request Item functionality in both UIs but I didn't focus on wording :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; I think it would benefit from DCAT feedback</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I can take a stab at rewording but I won't promise that it'll be proper English afterwards...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yes DCAT feedback would be great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm glad to help review any new wording too... I'm sure others in DCAT would be willing to help with wording if needed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; they're supposed to test during testathon anyway, right?! ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; and good point helix84_, I didn't check jspui wording</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mhwood too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84_&gt; it would also be good if the wording was the same in both UIs as much as possible (didn't check that, either)</span><br />
