<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, it's 20:00UTC and time for our weekly DSpace Developers Meeting.  Rough agenda for today: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-23">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-07-23</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First off, just wanted to thank everyone for helping to get DSpace 4.2 bug fix release out the door, especially Robin Taylor who "cut" the actual release, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mdiggory (~anonymous@cpe-76-176-128-229.san.res.rr.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, now it's pretty much "all hands on deck" for 5.0 release later this year!  At this time, there are no official plans for a 4.3 release, unless we have a serious bug or security issue to get out the door ASAP.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* bram-atmire cheers!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but fingers crossed that 4.3 won't be needed anytime soon ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; if at all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-green">* pbecker (55d42c85@gateway/web/freenode/ip.85.212.44.133) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; Hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that's basically it on the 4.2 front.  The rest of the meeting I wanted to start some planning and/or discussion around 5.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; pbecker is here just in time to volunteer for the 5.0 RT</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, hpottinger is reminding us that we are still looking for some 5.0 Release Team (RT) members, if anyone is interested. You can join the esteemed hpottinger &amp; peterdietz!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; Hpottinger: nice try, but I'm afraid I cannot be part of the rt this year. Sorry.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I will concentrate on my major contribution dspace-rdf, if it'll get into 5.0.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we'll be here if you change your mind... any other takers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think I've neglected to mention this to almost everyone...the 5.0 release is going to coincide with the birth of my second daughter (due in late Nov.), so I'm going to be likely out-of-touch right around the actual 5.0 release time.  So, anyone who can find time to chip in will be very much appreciated.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; congrats!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Obviously, I'll be chipping as much as I can before the final release....but, I'll be sleep deprived and/or offline much of late Nov and Dec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; congratulations Tim!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: congratulations!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Things I'm thinking of for 5 are: batch UI import, rest management tools, maybe even configurable i18n from the UI... Basically, things that make it easier to manage a DSpace instance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Back to 5.0 timelines though, as of right now, reminder what the tentative schedule looks like: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+5.0+Status#DSpaceRelease5.0Status-TimelineandProcessing">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+5.0+Status#DSpaceRelease5.0Status-TimelineandProcessing</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; pbecker2 got his topic in first.  Linked Data, anyone?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; ok, maybe not lurking…</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker2&gt; we can go on with html5 and come back to linked data later or next week. ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I just wonder if HTML5 support is pervasive enough to depend on it.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; cool. I did not head time to read my mails. Just came in just in time for the developer meeting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; pbecker: can you comment on SPARQL support in your branch?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; mdiggory: of course. What do you mean exactly?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; --&gt; To do so it should provide the converted data as serialization of RDF and over a SPARQL endpoint.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker meet mdiggory (if you haven't already). mdiggory is big into Linked Data / RDF, etc ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; lol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; thanks tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I use SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol to connect the Triple store to the repositoriy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; just wanted to provide some background :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; The Triple Store itself provides all converted data over a public readable SPARQL endpoint (if configured correctly).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I see support for consumers to produce RDF and Content Negotiation in your work are you also providing a SPARQL endpoint?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I convert the repository content into rdf and stores the rdf in a triple store. The triple store provides a sparql endpoint.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; what triplestore technology are you using at this point?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; DSPR#568</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/568">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/568</a> ] - DS-2061: Linked (Open) Data support for DSpace by pnbecker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I'm using Apache Jena Fuseki, but you can use every Triple Store that supports Sparql 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; how do you find the write performance on Fuseki?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I don't care mutch about the write performance, as I suppose that data in repositories is much more read then it is written or changed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; And cause I'm using Sparql to connect the Triple Store I can change the used Triple Store easily</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; You can really use the triple store you like, as long as it support Sparql 1.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the write performance is important from a Consumer standpoint when new content is being imported</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I had no problbems in my tests.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; but I have not done any speed tests.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I discuss because we have a project with WHOI that is similar.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I can mail you access to my test repository tomorrow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; We leverage the OpenRDF Sesame API for serialization and are currently providing a Sesame repository for SPARQL support</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; of course, preformance is a challenge with non-native triplestores (java) as the number of triples increases</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I'm not using it in a productive repository right now, cause it is not completly finished (and there is a problem in DSpace that prevents us from using DOIs in LD). I only have a quite small testrepository.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; But as I set before, if there is a Problem with fuseki, we can change the Triple Store really easily.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; yes, similarly with our work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; mdiggory: I would be glad, if you would take a look on DS-2061.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, wondering if there's an opportunity for @mire / mdiggory to collaborate (or give more direct feedback based on experiences) with pbecker on this work.

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; there is some great overlap, we have written consumers and a serialization "framework"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; mdiggory: Can I take a look on that? Is there some information available about it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; our challenge was that we have alot of "subject centric" RDF that needs to be produced for WHOI that is specific to oceanographic research. So the framework is a customizable/pluggable serialization layer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; pbecker: we can work out a means to get you a look</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; just to be sure, to understand you correctly: a serialization layer to serialize content/metadata stored in DSpace as RDF?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like a good idea :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; re 2072: what's the "right answer"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 2072 is a bit worrisome, as we have two UIs which do entirely different things with uncommitted changes...and it causes very odd bugs to pop up along the way (like DS-2012, which only affects JSPUI cause it gets "auto-committed" by XMLUI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2012">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2012</a> ] - [DS-2012] JSPUI does not write column last_active in database as context is not commited after login - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would suppose that there is code in each which depends on that final disposition.  We'd have to comb through them carefully, if we want to change either.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: that's essentially what I'm asking all of you (and I also asked on dspace-devel).  The "right answer" to me is that we need both UIs to act the same way...but I'm open to suggestions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would like them to work the same, for sanity's sake, but it may not be simple.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yep, I agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; which is also why I figured I'd bring it up now...as we are very early in the 5.0 timeline still</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Perhaps it's too much info at once here :)  I did also start a thread on dspace-devel for comments/suggestions...it's just something I hope we can work to try and resolve (one way or the other), preferably for 5.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, if we make JSPUI commit uncommitted changes, we fix 2012 and 2072... and maybe break something else?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, if we were staring at blank editor windows, ready to code up XMLUI and JSPUI from scratch, which way would we choose:  finally commit or finally abort?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; mhwood: that is a really good question.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yes, that's the question.  Should our "finally()" cleanup by auto-committing any changes from the last request (which didn't result in errors)....or should it just throw them out (abort).  The former is what XMLUI does, the latter JSPUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; If I were staring at a blank editor window, I'd make Rails UI, that uses REST... I'm not sure where the context committing comes into play at that point though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: having the JSPUI do an auto-commit likely won't "break" anything...just more a question of whether that seems "OK".   Having the XMLUI do an abort() however likely will break (some or many) things (hard to know for certain).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; For this issue, I'd be cautious about not creating too many new issues, and just adding a context.commit in jspui, shortly after the login...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; if XMLUI does an abort, we'll have to explicitely commit certain things after login, (DS-2012)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2012">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2012</a> ] - [DS-2012] JSPUI does not write column last_active in database as context is not commited after login - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I would be afraid to commit anything without knowing what gets commited. so if I would start in a blank editor, I would abort the context, if it was not commited before.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, my question supposes that we are going to design the code to be compatible with one or the other.  Is one a better starting point than the other?  Which one do we *wish we had*, so we know what to look for, and roughly where, if we want to fix this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; i.e. if you have an action, like Edit Item. You should commit that changed value right away. And not rely on mysterious end-of-the-line "garbage collector"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; See, for me, I actually kinda like what XMLUI does...but it could be deemed "unsafe" practices (for the reasons pbecker states, which I can completely understand).   XMLUI says, if an error happened, I'm aborting...but as long as things didn't error out, lets ensure it all got committed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; peterdietz +</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was going to say that's a third choice, but having no catch-all means that the catch-all is abort, when the Context is destroyed, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, peterdietz, pbecker &amp; bram-atmire all seem to like "the JSPUI way"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; see, when tdonohue puts it that way, it seems benign...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I prefere "the JSPUI way", but I can imagine how much it would hurt to get this into XMLUI without knowing XMLUI well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Another way of looking at this is that some of us don't have a good grasp of the transaction boundaries.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; perhaps the "right way" is the JSPUI way, but I worry about the risks of not finding and fixing all the dependencies on the old behavior</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, fixing the XMLUI could be a bit of an ordeal...but, if we make a decision that "the JSPUI way" is more correct, then we should start to investigate fixing the XMLUI to see where it misses "commit()" calls...maybe there's only a few...we won't know until we dig deeper. I was more trying to gage whether we need to dig deeper or not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and it sounds like we have more folks leaning towards "the JSPUI way"...which answers the question.  We need to dig into the XMLUI to see how hard it would be to "fix it" to act like the JSPUI in this scenario.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and whether or not that's achievable for 5.0...or if it just remains a "known issue")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think I agree.  If you don't know what state the Context is in, abort it before you go.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so the fix for 2012 is to add a context commit somewhere after login, and we'll have to do it for XMLUI, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Don't save unknown stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Commit goes in dspace-api and we make sure that all UIs are okay with this.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: I still personally think the fix for 2012 is to do a *commit* immediately after the "eperson.update()" call. There should be nothing else on the Context at that point, as you just authenticated.

<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; interessting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; although some of those are *Solr* commits...not Context.commit() now that I look more closely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The reason here is that our API is a bit of a mishmash...it's not just a simple API layer...it also does contain some Business Logic which is shared across both UIs (as we don't have a separate "Business Logic" layer to put that shared code into...other than the new REST API, which currently isn't used by either UI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I know.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; Do you see my point, why I would never expect a commit there?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, If, for example the UIs both used REST API...then it'd make more sense to have more of the "commit" calls come in REST API, rather than in the dspace-api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I'm not totaly against commiting their, Im just curious if this is really a good way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: I can understand your concerns and confusion here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I guess the other way of looking at this... do most of the JSPUI servlets call context.commit() or complete()?  If so, then maybe that is the "best practice" for JSPUI afterall.... (I admit I mostly do XMLUI these days)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i.e. part of this may be an "XMLUI way of doing things" vs "JSPUI way of doing things" question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I'll take a look on that tomorrow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; good point.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; have to leave now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; was a good developer meeting today. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if it ends up being the "best practices" for JSPUI, then I'm not against 2012</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks! have a good evening</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I'll take a look on other jspui servlets tomorrow.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; peterdietz: i.e. if you have an action, like Edit Item. You should commit that changed value right away. And not rely on mysterious end-of-the-line "garbage collector"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; [1:59pm]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; if you are importing alot of items and each one gets a db commit to assure that you can keep the previous ones should an error arise… you are issuing new solr writes in each case that a Context commit happens. repeatedly commiting solr in this situation forces it to reload its searchers and in-memory caches inefficently</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; autocommiting takes this responsibility away from the code and allow solr to be optimized in this situation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; as we get into more situations where mutliple items are updated at once, the more important it will be to not force a commit after each item is reindexed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I think I'm talking about database/context commit. After you do something in the UI to change a single item. It should write that to the Database. Won't an eventlistener get notified to add a change to SOLR's queue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; If you had a batch changer, you'll probably not commit after each singular change. But wrap the series of changes into a transaction that you commit at the end.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I've noticed that newly submitted items (in DSpace4) don't show up in solr right away, but maybe after 10 minutes they appear. If I do /dspace/bin/dspace index-discovery they show up right after</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I think after a submission might be a good time for a SOLR.commit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; it depends on the case, if you want to be able to rollback the whole set of changes on failure of one, yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; however, there are cases where you want to incrementally commit to the db and the have some "marker" at the failure point (example ItemImport)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I see what your saying now about referring to db commiting...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; apparently I was quite active on this issue ;-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; This is why we need a business tier.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I beleive that in XMLUI the autocommit functionality is designed so that you don't commit in midstream processing as many different changes may be enacted by a request in the Cocoon pipeline (i.e. multiple actions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the goal is to allow developers to insert new actions into the pipleine and beable to allow additional changes to be added within that commit window</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I beleive it is an intentional design that could probibly be confirmed by checking with Scott Phillips</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory, could you please copy &amp; paste that into 2072 comments?  I have to run, but that does actually sound completely plausible</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I just beat you to the punch :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; awesome! Just saw that, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; sounds reasonable. As long as none of the pipelines have to abort the context (rollback/zero-out the changes), then the finally says to context.commit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and if that is the case...this may be a developer documentation issue...letting everyone know WHY this works how it does, etc</span><br />
