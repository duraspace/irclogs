<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First up for today, updates / final push for 5.3 release!  We're down to just 2 PRs still open: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/milestones/5.3">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/milestones/5.3</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Both of these PRs (DSPR#973 and DSPR#943) just need more testing before we can merge them. Anyone willing to help in that area?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/973">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/973</a> ] - DS-2358: Preserves custom policy rules during versioning by pnbecker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/943">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/943</a> ] - DS-2571 Fix jumping to value in descending browse by aschweer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd will test 973 (didn't see the latter commit), already tested 943</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 943 indicates possibly more work to be done?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm personally pretty confident in 973. I tested it earlier on, and asked for a minor update (which has been made in the most recent commit).  I can volunteer to give it another sanity test myself as well (thanks kshepherd)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree, I'm unclear on 943. Is it "better" (worth merging) or "needs more work"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; The browse jump one. This is something that used to work fine before? And 5.x created an issue. Did we isolate what caused it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; "However, it appears that the fix broke the behaviour when jumping to a partial value."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: we fixed the *major* issues with browse jump.  But, this is an additional one that seems to have popped in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it was to do with unescaped colons in solr queries, i believe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; or, that was one of the issues anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; in this case, i think the SolrBrowseDAO just forgot to include/persist filters</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The unescaped colons issue was a different PR (DSPR#981), which was already approved and merged</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/981">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/981</a> ] - DS-2602 : Fix Title/Date browsing, also properly escape special characters in Solr by tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; no, more tricky</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; eh... i can explain the symptom, anyway ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I guess the question on #943 is whether it's "ready" or needs more work/analysis? And if the latter, is it something that we can do quickly or do we need to reschedule</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; more testing would be cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; blame on SolrBrowseDAO.java says DS-2193 had a similar change right about where DSPR#943 is working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/943">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/943</a> ] - DS-2571 Fix jumping to value in descending browse by aschweer</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i think it's better than nothing, if the choice is just "merge" or "wait for someone to do something after 5.3"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. good to know it's at least "better", kshepherd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it fixes the issue for item browse but not author browse basically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone else here have some time to give PR#943 a test?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Oh, OK, I'll test 943</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks, hpottinger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, we now have testers for our final two PRs!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Now, release date for 5.3.  Initially we had set a goal of tomorrow. But, that seems highly unlikely to me now.  Next week sometime, perhaps?  Anyone want to volunteer to do the honors?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; more tumbleweeds</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i could try, but i'd probably do something wrong and delete the whole github repository or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, don't everyone volunteer at once.  We just need one of you all :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger claps kshepherd on the back, Good Show!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: you could try. But, I've heard it's hard to delete all of GitHub when running Maven commands</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hah, this is true. so it's the sonatype stuff you want volunteers for?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; so i'll delete maven central</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; meh, it's backed up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeah ok i can do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: yes, it's really cutting the release (via Maven + Sonatype).  I'll gladly help with the announcement parts, if you want, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; only tricky bit is GPG keys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: thanks! If you manage to delete all of Maven Central, you'll be famous (or infamous).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; well, that and remembering to turn on mirage2 and dspace-lni</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: so the followup question...is there a day that works well for you?  If you want support via IRC from others, I'd suggest a morning for you / afternoon for (most of) us</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; next wednesday 28th, morning (that's tuesday 27th, afternoon or evening for you folk) would suit me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; if it has to be earlier i can probably do it on sunday my time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; My calendar says Tuesday the 28th, Monday the 27th.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I can be backup for Tuesday, will be in IRC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Tues/Weds sounds fine to me honestly. We don't need to rush it in earlier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yes sorry mhwood is right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i did some metal overadjusting for timezones :P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; wednesday 29th my time, tuesday 28th your time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; very metal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, that's clear, thanks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; and that's mental overadjusting, but maybe it's metal too. *moshes at hpottinger while playing air guitar*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Sounds good. So we'll aim for Tues 28th (afternoon, USA) / Weds 29th (morning, NZ)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That being decided... we just need to get these last PRs ready to go this week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Noted on my calendar for 28-Jul-2015 16:00 EDT.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anything else regarding 5.3? Sounds like we have a plan &amp; we have testers to do the final PR testing this week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK, hearing nothing...next up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger is building 943 right now in vagrant-dspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Migrating OFF of SourceForge! Yay! (not really)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Yay, really, and migrating, really. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeah sourceforge is a pain even when it's online ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In all seriousness, I don't have a ton of confidence with regards to SourceForge anymore.  This last massive failure only compounded my frustrations from Feb (when we lost our mailing lists for 3-4 days then as well)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Oh, yea, so, skip this part next week, kshepherd: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure#ReleaseProcedure-CreatetheDistributionZipsforSourceForge">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Release+Procedure#ReleaseProcedure-CreatetheDistributionZipsforSourceForge</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; plus their strange behaviour of late, like taking over "abandoned" projects (read: projects now on github that push occasional releases to sourceforge) and wrapping them in adware-installers and stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I've already migrated all our Release Packages / Downloadables (back to 1.5.0) from SF to GitHub (under <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/releases)">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/releases)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: yea, that adware-installer stuff about SF is also disturbing, agreed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How does the release procedure need to change?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Next up, I plan to migrate *all* our DSpace mailing lists from SF to Google Groups (hopefully in the next few weeks).  Much more info will be coming though, as that will take more planning, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mhwood: probably just skip the "upload zips to SF" part i guess?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: good point. Release Procedure can still be "similar", but we'll post releases to GitHub.  For 5.3 though, I suggest we *still* post to SF though (as 5.x versions are all there)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i like the idea of distribution zips generally though... dunno how others feel about that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We do actually have to do something to indicate a release, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 5.3 distribution zips should be posted to *both* SF &amp; GitHub, in my opinion. Starting with 6.0, we'll go GitHub only</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Zip works and is natural for a Java-based product.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (It just feels a little rushed to not upload 5.3 to SourceForge, as we haven't even full informed the community that we'll be moving off SF altogether)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; tdonohue: yep fair enough</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; as long as SF is up, might as well upload the binaries, we can change course for 6</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case, this is mostly all just an FYI for now.  The last step to remove us from SourceForge is really to hardest...the Mailing Lists.  But, the Fedora team did the same mailing list move (SF -&gt; Google Groups) a year or two back, so I'm working from their notes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Once I get further along with the migration, I'll come up with a timeline/plan, and let *everyone* know (by posting to all mailing lists)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any questions/comments on all this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; sounds good to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK. moving along then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Next up, 6.0 topics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First up, just a reminder that we have a Special Topics Meeting *tomorrow* (July 23) at 15:00UTC / 11:00 EDT to learn about the @mire "Services API" work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Actually I did have a comment:  since there's no way to archive Google Groups traffic except to scrape it out as HTML, maybe there should be an account somewhere subscribed to each group, to capture new postings *as email*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Video will be recorded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mhwood: good idea, i might do that just for my own archives</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: Good question.  To be honest, I was planning on keeping our SF account around (not close it entirely, but lock it down so nothing is public).  So, one option is to continue to use the old SF lists as that sort of "archive" (which is actually what Fedora does)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Or we could use a different (similar) service, if you had something in mind</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; What I had in mind was just a subscription that goes to a mailbox which never deletes anything.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; understood. Just wasn't sure whether there was a particular tool you were aware of that did that :)  Or if it was a conceptual idea.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And which is recoverable as mail folders, of course, or we have the same problem.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; All it really needs is an account somewhere that can receive mail and has lots of storage.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; a few years ago, i wrote some stuff to ingest the dspace-tech mbox to a dspace archive, extracting things like headers, subj, attachments, links, etc. and storing them as metadata as well as the original object ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; just for fun of course</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it worked ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Interesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Here's how Fedora did their mailing list migration:  (1) Migrated SF list archives to GG, (2) Moved all subscribers to GG, (3) Locked down SF lists (no more postings), (4) Told everyone to now use GG, (5) Subscribed each old SF list to corresponding new GG list (as a "dark archive")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I was essentially planning the same idea. That does mean our "dark archive" would still sit in SF though. If we wanted to completely shut down our SF account, we'd need a different location to archive lists</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; There's a Perl thing that does this for mail lists (works from a mbox you feed it), I'm trying to recall the name of it, unfortunately, sourceforge is, um, down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If you're planning to keep the SF archives, I guess that's the simplest place to keep it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; nothing stopping us subscribing additional archivey addresses to the lists in addition to the SF dark archives, anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; For simplicity, that was my plan. To use SF as the "archives" still.  But, +1 kshepherd, I agree.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, yes, if anyone thinks of a better option, let me know.  One of the only detriments to Google Groups is the inability to export an 'mbox'.  So, it would be nice to ensure we still have a "complete" list archives somewhere that does allow for 'mbox' export (which SF does do)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; maildir &gt; mbox imo, but yep generally agreed :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; true. Either is good :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. So, back to the 6.0 topic.  I mentioned the Special Topic Mtg tomorrow already.  It'll be video recorded for those unable to attend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other updates from anyone regarding 6.0 stuff?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, I have one actually. Late last week I did some more work on DSPR#991.  In that work-in-progress, I now have refactored ConfigurationManager to fully "wrap" ConfigurationService.  Still more work to come though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/991">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/991</a> ] - DS-2654 : Reloadable Configurations via Apache Commons Configuration by tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; sweet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yay!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, admittedly, I've put some of that work "on hold" until I see more about this "Services API" work. I don't want to generate too many conflicts.  As one might imagine, refactoring Config stuff can require a lot of tiny changes all over the API</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i have to get myself ready and go to the office now (i can't stay huddled in a blanket in my house all day :)) but just wanted to say you can all volunteer me for either (or both if that's what it comes to) of those refactor / deprecate lucene and db browse jobs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (unless someone else wants them)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Currently though, my conflicts should be minimal. I'm just "entering" an area where I might want to *rename* actual config settings, which is conflict-ful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; and i would probably start on them on sunday if i did end up volunteered for one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: if you want one, take the Lucene removal.  The DB Browse stuff is supposedly included in the "Services API" work (if we accept it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; see y'all next time, look forward to watching the services API recording</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; tdonohue: ok sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: so rip away at Lucene to your heart's content.  Bye!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd waves</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone else have updates to share for 6.0, or related comments?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we're running up against the end of the hour.  I don't really have any other updates/topics that come to mind today.  Any general thoughts/comments/questions/updates?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; any updates on the new UI work?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, and a quick update on the "UI Working Group".  Still in the works..Sorry this thing has gotten delayed &amp; delayed again. It is coming, and Jonathan should be sending out initial emails in the next week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The delays have been mostly internal (to DuraSpace). Too many staff vacations mid-summer, and we haven't been able to get this moving along as quickly as hoped</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any final thoughts/questions for today?  If not, we'll close things up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Very quiet now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, not hearing anything else. We'll consider the meeting closed!  Again, one last reminder to join us Tomorrow (Thurs, July 23) @ 15:00UTC (11:00am EDT) for a Special Topics Meeting on "Services API"</span><br />
