<span class="irc-date">[12:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Not quite sure we have a quorum, but it's logged, so we'll take a shot.  Mark, let's go ahead in your order.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; You take what you can get</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So, Brad and I discussed setting up some space in the Fedora confluence instance rather than setting up an entirely separate instance.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Chris has setup a space for us just a short while ago here:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; One organization with two Confluences does sound strange. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:18]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* bradmc (n=bradmc@207-172-69-79.c3-0.smr-ubr3.sbo-smr.ma.static.cable.rcn.com) Quit (Read error: 104 (Connection reset by peer))</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; you personally?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And neither am I.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; correct, we are excluding Graham from being able to edit the wiki from this point forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; Yeah, it could be taking exception to me. I am logged in ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So our first issue, permission ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; Fix the permissions, point a 'wiki.dspace.org' like URL at it: +1. Ok next topic ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I have a export/conversion of the dspace wiki to experiment with placing here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Let's be clear about the status of that wiki space.  I assume we're going to operate in an investigation mode until some date.  Graham says today, I'm thinking something more like August &lt;something&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; bradmc: correct, that was going to be my next comment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; We have some work to do getting it properly ported.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Shall we go week to week and see when we want to propose flipping a switch?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; We do not want a repeat of last time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; I was joking about going on the initial import. But yes, a move asap would be beneficial. Particularly if we get the Scroll plugin going and get focus documentation efforts on the new Wiki</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; we can have the documentation be a project separate from the wiki porting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:22]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* grahamtriggs thinking that we need to document 1.6 sooner rather than later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think we need to start identify in documentation concerns as JIRA issues?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Note that on documentation, Jeffrey Trimble is working hard and ready for input.  We should figure out how that interrelates with the wiki.  I still need to add that Jira field for doc status, I'll get that done.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; It was recently pointed out to me that someone was delinquent in updating the build, install and webapp customization instructions in 1.5.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; <a href="http://www.k15t.com/confluence/display/TEST/Scroll+Test+Space">http://www.k15t.com/confluence/display/TEST/Scroll+Test+Space</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Yes, that issue is on Jeff's list, and when he's ready with a doc update, we'll post it on ds.org, independent of any other release schedules.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; The question is getting him any text  any of you want to write.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Need a doc Component in JIRA?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; This is why I think we want JIRA issues for it, to track the activity, right now its happening in private emails and while I am going to contribute, it would be easier to manage in JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1 capture doc. bugs, improvements in JIRA just like other parts of the product.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; I'm fine with that; how does it compare / relate to issues in other components that have documentation associated with them?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That also makes it easier to not have to have Jeff do it all and remember it all.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think having a component call doc makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If a doc. issue is part of a code issue then it probably belongs with the code component.  But many doc. issues are primarily about the documentation itself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I don't think its a problem, you can seleect multiple components right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; seems "components" are more like "tags"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; you could also link a doc issue with relevant code issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and I wonder if its more important to have them represent salient focus areas in the project rather than concrete subprojects</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Okay, so we'll add the component for Docs, and also add the Doc status field to all issues, with Graham's proposed states:  needed, not required, in attachment(s),</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; in description, in comments</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Try a "documentation" component now and reorganize later if needed?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; if its easy for Brad to setup +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Done.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:36]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* bradmc wipes sweat from brow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Best if the documentation gardener announces this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; I'll follow up with Jeffrey.  Shall we move to next issue?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; best if the documentation gardner first knows about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; quick 2.0 update is more related to the two GSoC projects now related to it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; <a href="https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/storage-fedora/trunk/">https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/storage-fedora/trunk/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; will hold those GSoC project work activities</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the project reporganization that we done to date in the DSpace 2.0 has settled down and I am deeming it concluded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the ultimate outcome is that modules from dspace 1.x and DSpace 2.x can be managed/maintained within the same repository space</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; <a href="https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/">https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; which currently contains a mix of i18n, alpha and beta grade addons for dspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; In DSpace 2.0 these will all have their own release schedules</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Wow, quite a list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and versioning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:45]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* bradmc completes adding "Documentation Status" to Jira's field list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes, there quite a mix of stuff here now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and the status of all of it needs to be addressed somehow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; some are projects I dragged along from MIT's activities like dspace-history, policy,sesame</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; dspace-srw is the OCLC SRW webapp with just the DSpace driver</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; SIP is a contribution from Larry Stone for constructing DSpace METS packages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; radius ia a contributes radius authenication servlet for jspui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:48]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* mdiggory thinks he needs a new keyboard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; A single page gathering all modules together, with what-it-does, current version, status, link to more info., link to SCM would probably be well received.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; Okay, stats and events?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Geoip, Services, Solr and Solr-stats are are @mires current activity around statistics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bradmc&gt; mhwood:  +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I've passed some work around concerning the UsageEvent changes proposed for 1.6, but am very open to propositions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; More specifically, I may augment the proposal to instead be replacing the calls to UsageEvent in JSPUI and XMLUI with</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; <a href="https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/dspace-services/trunk/src/main/java/org/dspace/services/LoggingService.java">https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/modules/dspace-services/trunk/src/main/java/org/dspace/services/LoggingService.java</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and having a default UsageEvent based version of this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; in dspace-api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; The large question is "Is ther anyone using UsageEvent in the community?"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-green">* grahamtriggs (n=trig01@195.128.10.96) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Besides me? :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; MInho did use it in their port to 1.5</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; The major improvement I have been looking to get in place for UsageEvent is multicasting (or stacking of UsageEvent listeners</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; And the easiest way I've discovered to do this is to adopt usage of the DSpace 2.0 EventService implementation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; rather than implementing one from scratch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; This would replace the LoggingService api posted above with the DSpace 2.0 Event Service API</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; <a href="https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/dspace2/core/trunk/api/src/main/java/org/dspace/services/EventService.java">https://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/dspace2/core/trunk/api/src/main/java/org/dspace/services/EventService.java</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; AbstractUsageEvent would then be a EventListener rather than a Service</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[12:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; UsageEvent only exists because folks didn't think the other event service should be extended to non-content-model events.  If there's a better way to do it all with one mechanism now, let it be so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[12:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1 making usage event listeners stackable.  I should have done that to begin with.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Minho changes UsageEvent purpose to include content model changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:02]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* bradmc starts lurking while attending another meeting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; There is one dilemma I currently face, the UsageEvent API and the 2.0 Event service do not pass actual DSpaceObjects through to their listeners/providers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; just the identifiers for the objects (type, id)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So we lose information across the adapter?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; This is a controversial question: is it fair to pass the object itself or is that really bad form?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; mhwood: we loose the ability to efficiently see the state of the source objecct</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; The original EventManager designers took a very conservative stance that passing the object through opens the system up to possible inefficiencies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and state problems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; that they percieved a community of Event Consumer developers that would hold onto the objects and try to do things to them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; like change their state and call update etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; or place them on a queue for processing later asyncronously</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so the decision was made to for the EventManager/Event to be just a message, not a object container</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I tend to agree and think we have the appropriate capability in 2.0... I don't think I want to port the 2.0 caching tier to DSpace 1 however</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And then the design becomes dependent on the designer's understanding what event consumers will need to know about those objects.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; CachingService is the "savior" here in 2.0 You can always et back to the original object through it in your provideres etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think I agree, though, that one should have to do a bit of work to get references to the actual objects, to make one think about problematic uses.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; But, without caching, looking those object up again in the EventListeners will be costly and slow the system down unnecessarily when the object is already instantiated somewhere else in the request cycle</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; In 1.x that current location is the Context object</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How much re-lookup is likely?  What additional information would be necessary in the message to obviate the majority of re-lookups?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; The problem is that makes the Service have to be much more complex about guessing what information is relevant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Or:  what are event consumers wanting to do for themselves that could be done for them at low cost?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; for instance, in the statistics case, we want to take the DSpaceObjects metadata, attribute and parentage to construct a contextual logging event</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; this means we need a DSpaceObject to retrieve those from.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Likewise, we want certain other metadata attributes like contributors , titles, dates, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:17]</span> <span class="irc-green">* bradmc (n=bradmc@207-172-69-79.c3-0.smr-ubr3.sbo-smr.ma.static.cable.rcn.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; my point is that it would be best if the Event / EventService did just identify the object and force the providers/consumers to get a reference to it on their own, but its would also be very important to assure that is efficient by passing through a cached version of the object in something like the COntext</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And the event sink needs to know all of that?  I kind of expected that enough identifying information would be passed through to allow a whole 'nother process to look up what it wants later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; mhwood: I think we are in agreement here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The question is not just what do we need to know, but when do we need to know it?  We only need to know the title of an item, for instance, when we want to do something with it (like display it).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; At least, I have difficulty imagining many folk wanting to do real-time statistics on the *titles* of things.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; but authors of things and subjects of things, these are more relevant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think we will be safe with passing through the Context for the moment somehow so that the provider can complete its processing using its cache if available.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; In 2.0 Caching is hidden from the application inside the service</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Should we settle for BIG WARNINGS on the event interfaces, that you are in an area that is supposed to be fast and not hang onto references?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So doing something like new DSpace().getStorageService().getEntity(String id) is how everything would access the object</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and the service may or may not implement caching for efficiency</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Meanwhile, though, most of us aren't there yet, and we may have to just live with the idea that this is one place where Things Will Be Different In 2.0.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes, but it also means that the EventService implementation needs to assure this as well it can't be anything but a synchronous in process service</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm trying to bring the Mountain to Mohammed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; by providing a bare bones ServiceManager for 1.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; My thinking is that this is a case of "things will be easier and simpler in the next release, but for now please be careful in these ways."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; mhwood: I'm trying to prove that we can be both careful and innovative at the same time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, you know better than I at this point how much time and effort are involved in bringing these properties back to 1.x vs. just waiting until one is on 2.x and they're there already.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm being careful by bringing this stuff to the community for discussion prior to committing anything directly on 1.6, likewise, by working on these projects independently in the modules space, we allow them to evolve publicly to a state of maturity rather than dumping them into the dspace-api/etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; mhwood:  the problem is that 2.x needs more developers who understand the development model we are designing here.  There will need to be stepping stones between 1.x and 2.x, those are both important allow 2.x more time to mature and for 1.x to benefit from all the learning going on there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; maybe time to switch to that last uncovered topic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; since you are here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And backporting some of that model also helps to grow such developers.  Got it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Cocoon 2.2 blocks in 1.5.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Cocoon blocks:  I am in a twisty maze of passages, all different and most undocumented.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; this is a dilemma with cocoon, the nice thing about Cocoon 3.0 is that you will probably no longer look in the Cocoon community for this detail and instead look in the more properly documented Spring community instead.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Figures, I was just about ready to see if I could do something about the appalling Cocoon documentation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so where I get confused concerning the issue thats arising is that it doesn't happen for everyone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That is weird.  There's speculation that spiders are involved -- that some of them are trying to follow bogus paths through the namespace and triggering the bug.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; A colleague here thinks our troubles became noticeable just after he registered our site with a specialized indexer.  I don't know which but I can find out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; My recollection is that we've had this problem at a low level for a few weeks now (since we went to 1.5.2) but it came to a head just last week.  That would jibe with his observations.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I have a stupid little script that just asks for "HEAD <a href="http://hostname/"">http://hostname/"</a> periodically, and I saw this site disappear and reappear at intervals but could never catch it (until last week).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; when it comes to spiders... you need a good initial tier of defense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; For my previous work at MIT it was mod_cbandmod_cband</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; using it we could both throttle good crawlers and bad agents</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'll check into that one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and deliver more bandwidth for true users</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; One reason I've been squawking about getting the status codes right is that I want to provide sitemaps to help the search engines use less of our cycles.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I agree that that is important</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hmmm, independent of the current problem, we probably need to figure out how to reliably take up new releases of our dependencies in a modular way.  Ugh, the Cocoon documentation issue again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; is the current sitemaps implementation inadequate?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[13:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can't tell -- I can't inform Google of our sitemaps until I can verify the site, and I can't verify the site until they get a 404 for a nonexistent page.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; in the Cocoon case, we need to consider not using the "parent" module containers and sepect the specific artifacts we only require</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; sepect?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't know what it means either, but I was going to let it go -- the overall meaning is clear.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If my diagnosis is correct, asking for "/no-such-page.html" returns a 500 because that case is shipped off to a file reader which returns FileNotFoundError, which the &lt;handle-errors&gt; setup is not prepared for.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; we should also consider utilizing "excludes" more in our dependencies to secure against getting unwanted dependencies that may be added by the third party</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; "excludes" sounds good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So it looks for the file in the webapp directory?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; or is it looking elsewhere</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; like static/...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think it's looking for the file in the right place.  It's just that, if there *is* no such file in the right place, we should return 404 but this goes to the &lt;otherwise&gt; clause and returns 500.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, I think static/ is the place.  I'm drowning in sitemaps right now....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Unwinding a bit, Google is deliberately looking for a file that they expect not to find, to check that we are returning the proper status -- I suppose, so that they can rely on our status codes in other cases.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I actually fixed this issue once, inbetween 1.5.1 and 1.5.2, but someone introduced the static/ stuff and now these requests go down a very different path.  (And I got bogged down trying to provide an integration test so it doesn't get "unfixed" again....)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; *sigh*, I see I've done it again.  I should've posted an issue in JIRA, but I thought, "I'll just fix it and post the fix with the problem", it took way longer than I thought, and now nobody knows about it and I'm still tinkering.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Looking as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the thing is that the themes were supposed to be where static content originates from</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; not some separate directory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the way themes is mounted above and below the static stuff seems odd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The static-content fun begins around line 365 of the top sitemap.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I do not like this...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; &lt;map:match pattern="*.txt"&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;             &lt;map:read src="static/{1}.txt" /&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;          &lt;/map:match&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;          &lt;map:match pattern="*.html"&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;             &lt;map:read src="static/{1}.html" /&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;          &lt;/map:match&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yup, that's where I think the 500 problem came in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; something I've learned in creating themes is that you want static content to be mapped explicitly where it is located, I.E. the way themes is setup to resolve static content</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I vote this goes away...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That should solve my status code problem.  IIRC the first fix was down in the theme stuff, and was simply to specify 404 in such cases instead of letting it default to 200.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm still trying to grok why the last themes/themes.xmap mount is required</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I need to work on this all being delivered as blocks in 2.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That is the only reference to themes.xmap that I can find.  We do need one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Why this is hurting my head is that the "themes/*/**" gets the theme sitemap and I think is where the theme is executed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so its unclear to me the purpose of the later mount</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; themes/themes.xmap does the theme selection and sets the default theme.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I also suspect that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; &lt;map:match pattern="static/*/**"&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;             &lt;map:read src="static/{1}/{2}" /&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;          &lt;/map:match&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; should be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; &lt;map:match pattern="static/**"&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;             &lt;map:read src="static/{1}" /&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;          &lt;/map:match&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think I see, they are trying to allow things like "/my-file.html" to have global level static html, but do not want to store it at the global level...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory and mhwood....just catching up on your chat....I had added that "static/" stuff in based on a feature request for globally static content (across themes)...e.g. robots.txt, flat HTML "help" pages, google webmaster tools html, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i had thought that i had tested it to ensure it throws 404 when not found, but it's possible that a bug got in there somewheres</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: I think we should be careful about how we allow static content into xmlui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; understood...but, we needed a way to allow for 'robots.txt' and static help pages (Similar to jspui), and I had presented this as a solution...if there's a better way, feel free to rework it though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; we do want a good robots.txt in place regardless</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i was just explaining the *need* that it was meant to fulfill</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; yes, certainly, we have a need, just thinking about best practice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; sorry didn't mean to sound disapproving if I was</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, robots.txt is a special case:  we need one in every DSpace and it has a specific name and path.  So maybe special-case that file in the sitemap, and then think about other cases?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; also that pattern matching against "*.txt" and "*.html" should only be matching against "<a href="http://mydspace.edu/*.txt"">http://mydspace.edu/*.txt"</a> and "<a href="http://mydspace.edu/*.html"...so,">http://mydspace.edu/*.html"...so,</a> I'm not entirely sure that this is where the 500 problem is...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I need to setup a test instance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; doh, wiat, I already do...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The 500 problem, if I understand it, is that if you ask for /nosuchfile.txt or /nosuchfile.html, and the file doesn't exist, the reader throws an exception that &lt;handle-errors&gt; isn't configured to understand, so it goes through &lt;otherwise&gt; and comes out as 500.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: right, i think that's 100% correct...so, in my mind, why not change the &lt;handle-errors&gt; to catch that exception?    I also wonder if the &lt;otherwise&gt; should just return 404 by default, to be honest</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; <a href="http://pastebin.com/m74bf005d">http://pastebin.com/m74bf005d</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmm...so, why isn't that error being caught by the "not-found" case?  If it's a FileNotFoundException, shouldn't it be caught by that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, the 500 catch-all seems appropriate to me.  I tried defining a FileNotFoundException case, and it does pick up the error, but for some reason now I get 200 for that case no matter that I specified "status-code='404'".  I got pulled away before I could figure out why.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; odd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; it is happening at</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; &lt;map:match pattern="*.html"&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;         &lt;map:read src="static/{1}.html"/&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt;       &lt;/map:match&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; the not-found exception matches org.apache.cocoon.ResourceNotFoundException.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so /foo.html doesn't work while /static/foo.html does work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and returns the appropriate code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The reader throws FileNotFoundException.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory:  so, you only get that exception if you go to <a href="http://my.dspace.edu/foo.html,">http://my.dspace.edu/foo.html,</a> but not if you go to <a href="http://my.dspace.edu/static/foo.html">http://my.dspace.edu/static/foo.html</a>  ?  am I understanding that correctly?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; correct, likewise /xmlui/bar/foo.txt returns the correct 404 error page as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; likewise <a href="http://localhost:8082/xmlui/foo.bar">http://localhost:8082/xmlui/foo.bar</a> returns approriate 404 error page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; something is definitely broken then...cause this works fine with our IDEALS XMLUI (on Dspace 1.5.2):   <a href="http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/robots.txt">http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/robots.txt</a>   versus <a href="http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/static/robots.txt">http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/static/robots.txt</a>   (the latter throws a 404 as its not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (latter throws a 404 as the path isn't valid)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; it seems that the FileNotFound exception is wrapped in a org.apache.cocoon.ProcessingException: Failed to process reader</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; we may try adding the exception and seeing if we can unroll it in the configuration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; <a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.2/core-modules/core/2.2/1379_1_1.html">http://cocoon.apache.org/2.2/core-modules/core/2.2/1379_1_1.html</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; that looks like the right way to go in general...we should be unrolling more of these exceptions, likely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[14:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I did this bt like mhwood it catches the exception and is handled, but the status code is 200 instead of 404</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Um, I just tried  <a href="http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/static/robots.txt">http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/static/robots.txt</a> and I got a 200 with the "we can't find the page you asked for" page.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood...yep, you are right...that is broken...and i notice accessing a non-existing file throws the same error: <a href="http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/foo.html">http://www.ideals.uiuc.edu/foo.html</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it is broke</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; digging... have errors being handled, but status code is still 200</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I added an exception case for java.io.FileNotFoundException</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, that's what I tried.  Got 200 instead of the configured 404, haven't yet worked out why.</span><br />
