<span class="irc-date">[19:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; i was wondering what is the best way to delete all communities/submcommities/collections from dspace since we're  ready  upload real data.  Any help will be much appreciated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; thanks in advance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; dspacebeginner_: you probably want to just do a fresh install, and keep your old install, just in case</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; welll, what about the look and feel like css/js , etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; dspacebeginner_: please restate your question, with more context, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; what is the best way to remove all communities/subcommunities/collections without reinstalling?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hi, over on #dspace I've been advising him to dspace clean-database, dspace setup-database, and empty the assetstore directory, remove index files....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; thanks mhwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, sure, that works, too... though, *easiest* way is to just start over with a brand new install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; mhwood, seems like are you most knowledgeable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; With the proviso that I haven't really done that myself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh, there's lots I still don't know about DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; how long have you used dspace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't recall precisely.  Since sometime around 2000, I think.  We started on 1.2 if I recall correctly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[19:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I trust hpottinger's advice.  There's several ways to do this.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If you are customizing your DSpace in the proper fashion, your customizations (except, perhaps, dspace.cfg) should be in your [DSpace-source] directory, and a fresh install ought to install them into [DSpace] again.  It's more work but it does ensure that you haven't left anything behind that isn't wanted.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; thanks, mhwood. Honestly, if your goal is to have a fresh DSpace to work with, I'd go with a new install over a "recently-vacated" install. Ahh... that new repository smell.... :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; My way is faster, but I don't *guarantee* that I've mentioned every last thing that should be removed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't reinstall DSpace often enough to retain all the experience.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; you should try Vagrant-DSpace... then you'll reinstall all day</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Probably we should work out the Official Method for emptying a DSpace instance and document it on the wiki.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Just noticing this discussion. One other thing to consider is whether it's worth keeping your Dev/Test environment running *in parallel* to your new Production environment.  Many institutions have both a Test &amp; a Production install, just so they can continually have a "sandbox" to try things out in Test, before moving it to Production.  So, if you think that'd be useful, you may want a totally fresh install for Production</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Good point tdonohue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I suppose it depends on how much development one intends to do after going live.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, a "Test" environment is not *just* for development.  It also comes in handy when you'd like to test a "bulk upload" or similar, before running it in Production</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; True</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, even institutions who don't do custom development sometimes have a Test environment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I tend to just check out a copy of our local current production from the VCS and install it when I need to try something, then throw it away when I'm done.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood should be using Vagrant-DSpace for sure...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; hpottinger should be getting a commission from Vagrant.... :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; well, i'm using AWS EC2,  planning backup dev instance and launcing EC2 Dev instance and change a few configuration to point to production server.  to me, this seems to be the quickest way?  thoughts?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Mechanically it sounds reasonable.  I studied running DSpace on AWS, but always hated the thought of storing user credentials in someone else's facility.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The password store has been hardened a bit since then.  I might take another look.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspacebeginner_&gt; has anyone configured DSpace using Amazon S3 for storage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Isn't demo.dspace.org done that way?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Anyway, if you want to keep a test instance then, well, you have one now, so just push it aside and create a new one from the same [DSpace-source] for production.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sorry, I have to leave early today.  Anything else before I go?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Bye!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, I'm getting the same commission from Vagrant that I get from DSpace :-)</span><br />
