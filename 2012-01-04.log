<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; Hi All, sorry by my terrible attendance as of late. Networking is an absolute nightware on my new work computer... e1000e constantly drops me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; locally, I've found it to be very useful to add a function to DSpaceObject called getTypeText(), so that you can get the word BITSTREAM, COLLECTION, etc, instead of having to do Constants.typeText[dso.getType()]</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh, great:  I just ordered an e1000e yesterday.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DSObject.getTypeText() sounds like a good idea -- other code shouldn't have to know how to make the translation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; BTW you are only the third person to actually say something here since 0803 ET.  I think there's no meeting set up today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; public String getTypeText() { return Constants.typeText[this.getType()]; }</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; its still on my busy-time on my OSU calendar.. and.. I'm still late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; About what I expected.  This is a good time to propose deep-down stuff like that, with 3.0 presumably about to start...unless 3.0 changes make it irrelevant somehow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, the DSpace shared calendar has meetings every week, including this one.  The agenda page hasn't been updated since 07-Dec though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks like I dropped the baton on the 21st, as I didn't ask for a volunteer to take it for 28th or today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; deep down cuts sounds good. Replacing everything with Services still feels foreign to me...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; But I was trying to swap out solr in favor of mongoDB, and xmlui had some serious hardcoded dependencies on SOLR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I do wonder why we have quite so much complexity in Services, instead of just deciding to become a Spring app. or some such and letting *that* framework handle the wiring.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hmmm, one place too much(?) abstraction, the other not enough.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; so chicken verse egg.. Do we clean up DSpaceObject, Community, Collection, MetadataValue, DCValue[], etc... or switch to relying upon the service, and whoever implements the service has to clean things up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Really the same thing, no?  Either revise the contracts for DSpaceObject et al. or write equivalent contracts into new interfaces for those Services.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And I think there was some desire to coin interfaces off the existing classes to facilitate Service-izing...we need some decisions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; call me a legacy application maintainer guy, but I'm more interested in additional functionality like metadata-for-any-DSO, or versioning-of-bitstreams, than I am in swapping out entire backend for "mystery" alternative</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I tend to be incrementalist on things like moving to Services (maybe you noticed).  If a DSOService is desirable, and we could do that as part of revising the contract, then go for it.  Re-orienting the entire codebase to Services all at once feels like too big a chunk of time spent not working on stuff that the user actually sees.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OTOH DSpace is written in an OO language but often in very non-OO ways, and in some cases that makes improvements more difficult than they should be.  We could get more from Java.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I know I've seen examples but can't think of specific ones just now. :-/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I do worry whether we spend too much time on rearranging the guts of DSpace vs. making it a sharper, more capable tool.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; So long as the areas a local-developer might be interested in touching are clean enough (i.e. curation tasks), vs things that are not touched by anyone org.dspace.core.Collections</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Must go.  'bye!</span><br />
