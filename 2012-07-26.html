<span class="irc-date">[14:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; I'm hoping that some of the developers listed as being on are actually here; there was interest expressed during OR in more DCAT members using this channel to communicate so they could see what's going on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Yes, me, too!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Mark Diggory, are you here?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; Let's give Maureen a couple of extra minutes to log on, then perhaps you could lead off Sarah?  I'm intending to largely lurk since I'm not a metadatarian ; I'm here to do the grunt work you assign me.  :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Oh no, I was also intending to be somewhat lurkish.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; Depending on his chat client, he might get an alert if you include mdiggory in your message</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi Amy_, Maura and spotvin.  Just a quick FYI on IRC...you can "ping" people by mentioning their username.  So, to ping Mark Diggory you'd just say mdiggory (his username).  Pinging them usually will make their IRC window "flash" or similar on their desktop, to let them know someone has mentioned them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Thanks, tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aha..I see barmintor just said the same thing :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; hmmm...well, I get the impression Maura has some experience, so perhaps she can helpus get started?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; Thanks, Tim!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; and barmintor</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; spotvin: No problem.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; I have metadata experience, but I am new to what we want to do for the dspace update.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; mdiggory, I mentioned you in particular because we were looking at the comments you added to some of these tasks in JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; Okay, then, into the dark yonder woods we shall go....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; I can start us off</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; Thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; So, this seems to be a rather thorny issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; what makes it a thorny issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Deceptively simple to think of updating the registry to DCTERMS with some plan for migration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; but thorny given the other demands for metadata and modeling in DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Here are some potential thorns:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; As Amy has mentioned: 1) interest in other schema; 2) migration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Also: 3) potential need to align with the Fedora model</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; 4) potential implications for harvesting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; 5) how does this fit into demands for linked data / semantic web?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Do you think that we can clear some of the thorns away by declaring it our mandate to come up with a plan to update DCTERMS?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-green">* MWalsh (8092add0@gateway/web/freenode/ip.128.146.173.208) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Hi Maureen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; Hi Maureen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt;   Hi Maureen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; Hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; Sorry I'm late, previous meeting ran over</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; I think Sarah has a good idea in that we need to simplify what our task is to be.  Really, the first step needs to be to determine what current version of DC we need to get in place, then make that happen.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; NP Marueen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; *Maureen*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; i.e., to acknowledge that, while there is much to be done to update the metadata model in DSpace, we are going to simply focus on the DCTERMS issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; Agreed-that's probably where we need to start in order to make anything later happen.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; So I have what may be a pretty basic question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; If as Valorie said the goal is the simplest first, then we may need to saty with element.qualifier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; the current DIM model is basically a schema.element.identifier model, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; ah ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; correct...DSpace currently only supports metadata structured like "schema.element.indentifer"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; so, I haven't seen this in action, but is it kosher, for example, to have dcterms.contributor.advisor?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; if we move to terms than we need to deal with a host of config changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; and I think that's where the rub comes in for the developers--gets complicated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; so to begin with the simplest would be to update the our elements/qualifiers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; I agree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; So, MWalsh, does that mean we can't implement terms?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; if we were to we would need to re-model DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; so not kosher to do dcterms.x.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; or, really, just not useful?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Why can't you simplify and do something like "dcterms.x.x"?    I'll just note that "re-modelling" DSpace metadata is potentially a rather large (likely multi-year) project</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; I think there's a desire on the part of repo managers, from what I heard at OR for dcterms</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; so the consensus is to go to dcterms and dcterms.x.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; unless there's an overriding reason to not do so, yes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; point of info: implementing "terms" is distinct from implement "dcterms," or no?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; different namespaces, I think (?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; Okay, so if we're going to look into implementing dcterms, how do we start?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; I was thinking when it was said to stay simple that we would update the existing - i.e. not citation but bibliographicCitation, but by simple first we are going in the direction of impleting terms in a way that fits with current DSpace model</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; does it make sense to do what MWalsh suggests, then move on to something larger?  will it be 'cleaner' in the long run?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; MWalsh, would an example of that be: dc.identifier.citation migrated to dcterms.bibliographicCitation?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; (I mean an example of updating the existing to stay simple?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 MWalsh.  I agree...I think you want to stay simple.  A few options would be to :  (a) update the default "dc" schema so that it's more in line with standards, And/or (b) split the "dc" schema into multiple schemas (e.g. a new "dcterms" schema?) if needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; If we update existing it would be dc.identifier.bibliographicCitation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; of course spelled right unlike my typing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; so what I'm hearing is that we should take tdonohue's option a first, then, if we can and think it in our purview, move on to option b</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; I think as a first step we should look at the exsiting and update the ships with to be current and in same model</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; then we look into creating a new namespace for terms - that way it can ship with both</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; makes sense to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Admittedly, my options "a" and "b" could be done at the same time (or you could do them in order).  In some ways, there's a lot of non-standard-DC stuff in the "dc" schema that probably needs to be moved elsewhere.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; so we have at least one release with an iterim step for people wanting to move to terms and a model for adding new namesapces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; spotvin and Maura-any thoughts on pursuing that option?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; there is alos the issue of lock down. local additions abound. talk was with current to lock donw elements but leave qualifiers open</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; yes, that's what I remember, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; And the new namespace would go into a separate registry?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Yes, I think that was mdiggory's suggestion in JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; the issue of non-standard gets at the metadata solutions for features</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; related to "lock down", I know the committers have been talking for a while (years?) about whether we should lock down the *entire* "dc" schema (and make it only DC-standard fields) and suggest people add new fields to a new "local" schema (for local metadata additions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; yes- separte registries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; my concern is how terms metadata will be harvested</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; tdonohue, I think there was some opposition in the survey to locking down dc entirely; doesn't mean it shouldn't happen, but I'm hesitant to do so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; tdonohue, would locking down include excluding those local qualifiers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; Maura - crosswalks will need to be addressed as well as any hard-coded dc that may be affected.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; MWalsh, could you give another example of a dc element that needs to be cleaned up?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; spotvin: what do you mean by "local qualifiers"? I don't understand the context?  I just meant you'd do the following: (a) change the "dc" schema so that only standard DC fields/qualifiers exist in it, (b) lock down the "dc" schema for editing, but allow people to create/modify all other schemas as needed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; tdonohue, I mean the homegrown qualifiers (like dc.identifier.madeuplocationschema) that might be added. It seems like these would be relegated to another schema.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; or, rather, to another registry</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; local qualifiers are things that are "standard" now in DSpace, as "advisor"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; correct, spotvin.  The committers have talked about creating a default "local" schema for that purpose.  So, you'd add your local fields qualifiers to a "local" schema...e.g. local.identifier.onlinecatalog (or similar)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; barmintor: I couldn't figure out why the mptstore issue was happening, but did enough manual testing last week and this week that I was satisfied that it's not a blocker. queries such as the one being tested work fine manually. It seems pretty likely that it's a test-related problem. But it'd be nice to get to the bottom of the test issue eventually. Any insight you can muster would be appreciated.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, you can take my suggestions as just brainstorms... I admittedly am not a metadata expert here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; thanks, tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; MWalsh, as someone who's dealt with DSpace and metadata on a pretty intense level, what do you think of locking down dc entirely?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; For our current model, I do think locking down the element is important. Sharing via simple OAI-PMH is standarized if the standard crosswalk is used, but locking down the schema doesn't lock down the exposure per se</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; I think that a lot of the localization is due to limitations of the one schema</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; That's interesting, MWalsh. My concern would have been that the local schema items wouldn't be exposing via the simple OAI-PMH.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; exposed, that is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; I agree, but would the manager have to create a new schema for each small variation among collections</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; Until we have other options, I not convinced of locking down the qualifier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* mdiggory (~mdiggory@ip72-199-216-7.sd.sd.cox.net) Quit (Quit: mdiggory)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; so what are the next steps if we're going to move forward with the 'simple' task of bringing the current schema up to date?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; I think we need to start with 1.8 ships with and compare with current DCMI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; I actually have a spreadsheet put together by a metadata librarian that maps the 1.8 ships with and the DCMI (<a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)">http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; OK. we can work via email on that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; My confusion, though, is that beyond the citation example,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; I'm not really seeing any immediate comparisons that would help clean up a DC element set</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; tdonohue, how do you see a dc and a local working together, say for item import</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; spotvin, could you send that to us by email, and perhaps give us each a chunk of the sheet to work on?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Yes, just sent it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; MWalsh... I think it could be possible to "prepopulate" the "local" schema with some general suggested fields that could be already configured to work for item import / OAI harvesting, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; just got it spotvin, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the most important thing here (from a developers standpoint) is getting some suggestions on how to "clean up" the "dc" schema to make it more standard, and suggestions on other schemas (dcterms, local, etc) that may need to exist &amp; their fields.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; tdonohue, do you see a repo using local or a combo of the two</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Once we get those suggestions, the developers can try to figure out whether there's a way to make it work (it may require some programming, but hopefully not much)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; MWalsh -- you'd use a combo of schemas..  Things that are in standard DC would get saved to "dc" fields...things that are non-standard would get saved to "local" fields</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, many items would have metadata that includes multiple schemas, "dc", "local", possibly "dcterms", etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (or at least, that's my brainstorm)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Yes, I know in our IR now we have local and thesis registries, so ETDs are likely to have metadata from dc, local, and thesis</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; same here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; tdonohue, with the current dc, and what is by default exposed, the element is the standard. Do we want local for a standard element but local qualifier?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; MWalsh -- not sure I understand the question...can you give an example of what you mean?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Maura&gt; I don't know how we could cover all the local qualifiers in any one standard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; tdonohue, I'm also curious about what is default exposed with QDC-- is that standard across DSpace IRs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; The QDC crosswalk is problematic, and I don't think it ships "on"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Ah, ok, I've noticed some trouble with the QDC for our IR and wondered whether locking down the dc registry to only include what would go out in QDC could help determine what should be local and what should be dc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DSpace has a QDC crosswalk for OAI-PMH, but it's not enabled by default (it could be..if we felt the need to enable by default)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; tdonohue, current dc had dc.contributor.advisor for example. As discussed above, that would go to local.contributor.advisor, although as simple exposed it is standard dc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The QDC crosswalk is actually controlled by a "QDC.properties" file that actually *maps* many current DIM fields into dcterms...so it could be used as a starting point of sorts: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/config/crosswalks/QDC.properties">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/blob/master/dspace/config/crosswalks/QDC.properties</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; tdonohue, yes, by not shipping "on" I meant by default it is not enabled</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; MWalsh -- in terms of "exposure" (via OAI-PMH), we can create custom crosswalks to "map" local.contributor.advisor so that it is exposed as "dc.contributor".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think it's worth pointing out that we already do a *lot* of mapping of DIM fields to DC/QDC, etc. for exposure.  So, changing that default mapping should not really be a big deal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; This file is very interesting, tdonohue, thanks for sharing it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; so it looks like dc.contributor.advisor wouldn't be mapped out through QDC, anyways, in the current configuration?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; currently yea, it looks like dc.contributor.advisor isn't mapped into QDC by default (it's commented out in that file)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; right--my metadata people have complained about that before</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; sptvin, the QDC that ships is still the preliminary mapping made quite a while ago. when no mappings were found they were left out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; Ah, so interesting. thanks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; so maybe we should also update the QDC that ships ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; local IRs have more work with tha crosswalk than others for use</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In general, I think the committers/developers just need some suggestions on how to "clean up" our metadata schemas, and whether there are ways we need to *change* what is exposed via OAI-PMH.  None of us are metadata experts -- we know there are likely issues currently, we just don't know what all those issues may be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, if you could pull together suggestions on a wiki page or JIRA ticket, I think we'd be very willing to make them happen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; the QDC along with the other mappings will need to be addressed, but the QDC has never been enabled by default due to its 'preliminary' state</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; I think with the QDC we need to address how we are handling dcterms before we alter the mapping</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; So the current ideas are:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; 1. clean up the dc registry (the question of lockdown is open)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; 2. possibly suggest a new dcterms registry</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; (well, I should say that the question of lockdown for qualifiers is open. elements should be locked down)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; if we lockdown then I think we need to ship with a local mocked up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; that makes sense to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; I am still vague on how a dcterms and dc registry would coexist</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; would the dcterms registry be complete, or only contain items not covered in dc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; like dcterms.educationLevel?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; I think it would need to be complete</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; if we added a new dcterms namespace we should add a standard dcterms namespace independent of what we are doing in other namespaces, becaseu we want to go in that direction, adding otehr namespaces as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Not to add to the list, but the one other thing that was implied in the above discussion is "possibly determining if there are other often-used schemas (e.g. "thesis" or "etd" schema) that DSpace should ship with"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; yes, there is a standard ETD schema (thesis.x.x) that we could recommend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; that would be a huge deal for that community</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; maybe we could consider that when thinking about what local mocked up items to include</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; I am happy to work on the thesis question, since I am neck-deep in that work for my own IR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; but it seems like a big question in terms of other schema...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; If we add on now to what we are doing by adding additional namespaces, I would want to not add rthem to local, but add standard namespaces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I think figuring out a thesis schema would be great...it's actually been in our JIRA for some time (and we just need some suggestions): <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-531">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-531</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; yes, I agree MWalsh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; sorry to bail, but I need to run to my next meeting.  spotvin, Maura and/or MWalsh would you send an email and let me know what you need me to do next?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;spotvin&gt; yes!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Amy_&gt; thanks, all!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; MWalsh -- correct. I would not want to shove a bunch of stuff into a "local" schema.  Instead, the Thesis fields should be in their own schema (e.g. "thesis")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;MWalsh&gt; ok. we will email</span><br />
