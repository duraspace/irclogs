<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap1&gt; and let's go start for my first irc chat as committer</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think that's all we have time for.  Unless someone knows a clever way to figure out which service to use, we need to just tell DSpace with a configuration setting.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: well, if JSPUI does the same (which it sounds like it does), then that's "good enough" for XMLUI too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think cleverness would be wasted on a a deprecated search index, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, we just need a volunteer to fix 1621 then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Shall I just take this one and do that?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: sure, if you are willing. I think hpottinger is also right that we don't need to get too clever, as we've been talking about deprecating Lucene anyhow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm just going to add the parallel configuration setting and use it.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; bollini has claimed this one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; not exactly :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; do we want to do a status check then?  This is a definite "blocker"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it is mostly solved just need to be placed in configuration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; s/placed in configuration/noted in documentation/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; bollini meant to say: it is mostly solved just need to be noted in documentation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; my only concern here is that that could make hard an updgrade from &lt; 1.8 to dspace 4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it sounds like we need to note two things in the documentation: (1) the recommendation to run "stats-util -o" *before* upgrading to 4.0, and (2) how you can fix things if you forgot to run "stats-util -o" (or didn't follow directions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; (2) also apply in the case you are coming from a very old dspace version</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, exactly, bollini.  So, I think we need to add your "wget" call to the upgrade documentation as the "fix" if you hit these errors</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it not works if you have very old indexes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, so is there a different fix for very old indexes?  If so, we may want to document that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; on the demo site we had index files from solr 1.4 (lucene format &lt; 3)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Is there an intermediate step that would turn very old indexes into not so old indexes?  We could add that to the upgrade instructions for an earlier version.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; you cannot run optimize using solr 4 on lucene format index  &lt; 3</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: exactly, I had to setup a "dspace 3.2 solr webapp" just to update the index format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I wonder if we can recommend someone use a standalone java -jar lucene3.jar command to optimize their thing, if they are jumping a version</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; so if you come from old dspace you need to update to dspace 3.2, run optimize and go to dspace4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; PeterDietz: there are not lucene cmd line tools for that as far as I know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm worried here that others will not be re-optimizing their indexes on each upgrade.  Maybe we need to make that a *common instruction* in all our upgrade instructions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; PeterDietz++.  User doesn't need DSpace 3.2, just a Lucene-based tool that is new enough.  If there is one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; tdonohue++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; probably that but I haven't tested <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/lucli.1.html">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/hardy/man1/lucli.1.html</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, so we just need upgrade docs and to test them :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well, it sounds like we need (1) 4.0 upgrade docs &amp; test them (2) also tweaks to older upgrade docs (e.g. 1.8-&gt;3.x) to add the optimization step</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; or <a href="https://code.google.com/p/luke/">https://code.google.com/p/luke/</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Plus, it would be good to see if there are any general Lucene tools that can help folks who hit this issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maybe in 5.0 we can have a built-in tool for updating indexes, and let 'ant update' depend on it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, do we have any volunteers to tackle either the docs updates or looking into Lucene tools?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood++ great idea. I'd rather it happen "automatically" myself. Having to depend on folks running a series of commands is not the best solution (as people make mistakes)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can polish doco. but I don't know enough about Lucene/Solr yet to write these.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I think the general recommendation is just to add a "./dspace stats-util -o" command to *every* recent upgrade script (including our 4.0 one).  As that ensures your stats indexes are optimized &amp; up to date.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; for 4.0 though, we also want to recommend they run "stats-util -o"  *before* upgrading (Just in case they have never run it previously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But apparently it is not simple to determine whether stats-util -o will work, if you have been running DSpace through several releases.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; no, if you run stats-util -o with dspace 3.2 it will be fixed always</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; lucene brokes compatibility in 4.0 so you cannot solve using SOLR4 (DSpace 4) but you can solve it in dspace 3.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; gosh, I don't know how anyone would be able to keep DSpace standing up without regularly running optimize on their Solr stats core</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it will work if you run it between each upgrade...it just won't work if you skip upgrade steps.   So, to go 1.8-&gt;3.x-&gt;4.x (and run stats-util -o in between each), you should be fine.   Which is why we need the 1.8-&gt;3.x docs to say to run optimization, and the 3.x-&gt;4.x to also say to run optimization.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Can I use an earlier version of DSpace, if that's what I'm upgrading from?  How much earlier?  Is there a version that both has Solr and is too old to produce indexes that Solr 4 can upgrade?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 1.8.0 was the first version.  This only effects 1.8.x-&gt;3.x-&gt;4.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Hey.. Who's the wise person who thought of including an easy way to run solr optimize on DSpace ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok the stop version is dspace .18</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So if I'm upgrading 1.8.1 -&gt; 4.x I have to do *two* upgrades?  One is bad enough!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; if you have at least dspace 1.8 you can just run optimize before to upgrade to dspace 4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can run optimize *in DSpace 1.8*?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; if you have any version before dspace 1.8 (1.7,1.6, etc.) you need to do a two step upgrade passing for 1.8 or 3 and running optimize</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think you usually have to do the DB-upgrade script even if you skip an intermediate version. So, if you want to skip 3.0, you'll atleast need to git clone DSpace/DSpace; git checkout dspace-3.x; mvn package; ... ; dspace stats-util -o</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: you can always run it using wget</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and, I'd be really surprised if you weren't running optimize every night</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think "to skip DSpace 3", we can recommend people try java luke3.jar optimize</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; PeterDietz:  exactly.  Two upgrades.  Merging the database and config. tweaks is much less trouble than installing the whole thing a second time.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I feel like we are taking too long on this topic.  Per our "Support Policy" we only promise fixes to the last 3 major releases.  As of the point of 4.0, that will mean 1.8-&gt;3.x-&gt;4.x.  So, we really just need to concentrate on updating the 1.8-&gt;3.x docs and the 3.x-&gt;4.x docs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Well not quite two upgrades. I was thinking to just have a route for the person to get access to solr3 tools. They don't need OUR solr optimize command, just plain old solr.optimize.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; CLI for optimization. Sorry if I'm late to the discussion.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; Ok. I will try to use luke tomorrow to fix very old index and report the result on the jira issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; so we just need a voluntair to take this information in the documentation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; can we get a few folks to report things back to JIRA ticket.  I feel like we are spending too much meeting time on something we likely can document in JIRA and then have someone copy to official docs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we likely don't need to figure out all the answers now, but if we have a few folks willing to work together here, we can get this fixed/documented in the coming days.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; go ahead I have add a note to the jira issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can write documentation if someone can tell me what it should convey.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like bollini is willing to try figuring out what works, and mhwood is willing to help with docs. sound good?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; bollini meant to say: go ahead I have added a note to the jira issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I can pitch in with testing docs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like we have a plan for 1776 then. thanks all!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think this 1788  ticket just needs a volunteer to rename the scripts &amp; update our docs appropriately</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (as we had discussed this renaming last week)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, it's just renaming commands, and then documenting the new ones (and making sure other areas of the 4.x docs are updated to newest commands)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I thought we had discussed this as being a "bug fix", but I don't recall who was going to test it out, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Andrea Schweer provided a PR.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, I think it mainly just needs a review &amp; merger then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I volunteered to test</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger, do you want to test &amp; merge (if testing is successful) then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; yes, it's on my list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OK. I guess the other questions to bring up are similar to those that mhwood asked on dspace-release:   How do folks feel about 4.0?   Are things "stabilizing"?  Do we need more time? Do we need a second testathon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I haven't been able to do any Oracle testing, and as I mentioned on _commit, I'm not likely to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; With all these issues being worked, it seems likely that RC2 will slip a day or so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood has been doing some Oracle testing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will note that we also still have 71! tickets marked "fix for 4.0".  Some of those look like they are just doc updates, or possibly could be rescheduled for 4.1 or 5.0.  But, we probably should review them too: <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS/fixforversion/11140">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS/fixforversion/11140</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we are going to work much on oracle just not sure if in time for the official release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I let the Oracle users here know that if something is broken, it's up to them to report it. I got one acknowledgement, but no reports. So hopefully, nothing is broken.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, I have a recent master using Oracle 10g, but I don't know Oracle very well and don't really know how to exercise it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; do we need a meeting just to review our 4.0 tickets?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; BTW concerning hardware spec.s, 10g is running on an old Dell Optiplex GX280 desktop. :-/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger ++ , yes, we could have a separate meeting to go through 4.0 tickets to see if there's any "low hanging fruit" or ones to reschedule/etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; You can run Oracle on anything that'll run vbox</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Another task for 4.0: we probably should review our Software Prerequisites/Requirements.  For example, I'm assuming we will now require Java 7 (since Java 6 is end-of-life)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Do we recommend JDK7 (openjdk), or Oracle JDK7 ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I find oraclejdk7 such a PITA to install...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, and anyone else interested int testing Oracle, I'd suggest just trying to batch load some AIPs, and then mash away on the interface (try to add stuff manually, add an eperson, etc.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I hope the answer to that is "yes".  I'm running on OpenJDK.  Too much foolishness to get Oracle JDK installed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OpenJDK is running fine on Demo, I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: we support both.  Demo.dspace.org runs OpenJDK.  I'm running OpenJDK for all DSpaceDirect customers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Vagrant-DSpace uses OpenJDK7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DSpace 3 works fine on OpenJDK...as far as I've seen, so does DSpace 4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've had no problems with DSpace 4 on OpenJDK 7.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; elasticsearch.org recommends oraclejdk7... for performance reasons. I'm not sure that they've re-evaluated this position, or if its just old mantra. SunJava is better ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I ran DSpace 1.6-4.0, always on OpenJDK (mostly 6)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we strongly recomend oracle jdk to our customers but mostly due to some strange behaviour of openjdk6 and specific customization that we have done</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I've never done any performance analysis...so, it's possible there's slight performance differences, but there's no errors thrown by running DSpace with OpenJDK)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; openjdk7 seems to work much better but not really streassed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I thought that OpenJDK and Oracle JDK are mostly the same code, without/with a few Oracle-proprietary classes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, all in all... DSpace works with both. You should be allowed to choose whichever one you want to run</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-green">* jonathangee (~jonathang@142.68.37.238) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, I do suspect we should say that 4.0 requires Java 7 or above.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Does anybody know whether DS 4 still works well on Tomcat 6?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think things are better in JDK7. With openjdk being the "reference implementation", whatever that means... Sounds like we can recommend openjdk7 as our stance. You are free to use oracle-jdk7, as you might have some (as-of-yet un-noticed) improvements</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I'm running Tomcat 7 these days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think I was running DS4 on Java 6/Tomcat 6, as part of my failed attempt at brining my Oracle development stack back from the dead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; TC 6's days are numbered, but TC 8 is not yet out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: there was one issue with OAI on Java6, but I don't remember if it was fixed yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: I don't think we have to recommend one over the other. We can just say that DSpace 4 requires Java 7 or above. You are welcome to choose either Oracle Java 7 or OpenJDK 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I would say that DS4 will have some weird issues if you try to run it in tomcat5.5.. The REST API requires at least servletAPI2.5 (which is in tomcat6 and above)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We can say that developers have tested on OpenJDK and Oracle JDK.  Can't say the same for IBM JDK or Gnu Classpath or....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, that's good info, thanks PeterDietz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would expect weird issues if one ran *anything* in Tomcat 5.5 these days.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Our DS3 recommendations were Tomcat 6 or above. So we don't need to worry about Tomcat 5 or less.  We just need to decide if we stay at Tomcat 6 or bump up to Tomcat 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I will prefer to suggest tomcat7 (we will move on it with dspace 4)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So we're going to recommend Java 7 and up, and Tomcat 6? 7? and up?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Java 7 + Tomcat 7 seems reasonable to me.  (If folks want to run Tomcat 6, they can try it...but we just won't guarantee it's gonna work 100% right)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So our recommendation is Java 7+, Tomcat 7+?  Has anyone tried out Tomcat 8?  I haven't.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; (Tomcat 8 is not yet released, but very near.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I haven't tried Tomcat 8, as it's not released</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; since these are just *recommendations* I think we just detail what we know works.  We can clear up whether Tomcat 8 has issues later on by tweaking docs or adding JIRA tickets later as needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So we recommend Java 7+, Tomcat 7.  And we may update that in late winter or spring.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep. It's just like always. We tweak those recommendations often after releases (especially if we notice issues with specific versions of Tomcat or similar)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, do we want a separate meeting to review tickets still marked "fix for 4.0"?  Should we schedule that now?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I want to suggest to use the next jira backlog hour to do that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think we also require Maven 3?  Should we burn that into the dspace-parent POM?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it is the week before the release so it should be not surprising for the community that we are strongly focused on dspace 4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We can use the next JIRA backlog hour. I do want to note that there's a major US holiday next week (Thurs, Nov 28 is Thanksgiving).  I will be around on Weds for our meeting as normal, but I wasn't sure others will be traveling that day?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think I will be here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I.e. most folks in the USA will not be working on Nov 28 &amp; 29...some also choose to take off Nov 27 for travel)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: oh yes, maven 3 what else? I'm just forget about older versions ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Maven 3 sounds fine to me too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; maven 3 is fine, and good luck to anyone trying to use anything less</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Honestly, we should work to update all our version numbers to versions we are *actively* using (of Maven/Java/Tomcat/Postgres/Oracle).   If folks want to try older versions, they can do so...but we are not actively testing older versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 11/27 I will be at home with my kids, but I can check in to the meeting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; again, I had no problems with Maven 2.2.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Versions:  goes for Maven dependencies and plugins too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we don't have many reports on newer postgres versions. 9.1 seems to be the latest that more than a couple of people reported on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we're using 9.1 postgres for DSpaceDirect.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, hey, speaking of calendar stuff, I have RC2 on my calendar for tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I only tested DSpace 4 on Pg 9.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mmm... RC2, it is to early</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Tested on 9.2, our production (older) is on 9.1.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; RC2 will have to slip to early next week, yes?  :-(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I will prefer to have in at least the index renamed stuff fixed and also the embargo improvements</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; fine by me, RC2 on 11/28? the big cooking holiday?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm OK with pushing back.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; 12/4 is the final release date</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure who would release RC2 on 11/28 though. I'm going to be offline (completely) on 11/28 and 11/29</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Better to get more into RC2 than to push it out hastily and then have to do RC3.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; same here, I was mostly being silly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, it is worth noting that pushing back RC2 likely means we will need to push back Final Release (not definite, but more likely)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; :-( :-(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, again, I think that's OK.  The schedule is a *goal*.  If we miss slightly, no big deal.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we could bump RC2 to 12/4 and final release to 12/11</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we just want to try not to "miss" by too much...hopefully we'll still get final release out in early-to-mid Dec</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; why not try to RC2 on 11/25 ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, you available to pull the lever on RC2 on 11/25?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think we should aim for RC2 next week (keeps us trying to get the next fixes in), if possible.   We then can see where we are...possibly an RC3 the week of 12/4, or if we are "stable" maybe we can still do Final Release that week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I could do 25-Nov if that's what we want.  Are we reasonably confident that RC2 can become release?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm liking the way things look, honestly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We don't seem to have broken very much yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we will try to finalize the residual issues on the jspui side over the weekend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; thanks to lap1 to volunteer :-D</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap1&gt; who is lap1?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;lap1&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; On the XMLUI side, I think things look pretty good.  I still want to see what we (re-)discover in our review of the "Fix for 4.0" issues too...I'm hoping that there's nothing "hiding" there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we obviously can do as many (or as few) "RC" releases as we want to.  So, after RC2 we can decide if we are ready for "Final Release" or if we want an RC3, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, it seems like things are stabilizing...so I don't think we are very far from a "final release"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; well, it looks as we have a plan. RC2 on 11/25, final meeting for 4.0 on 11/27 and hopeful final release on 12/4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger scribbles on his calendar...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, I don't have any other official topics for today.  Next week we'll do "Fix for 4.0" reviews at 19:00UTC (Weds, Nov 27) instead of JIRA Backlog hour, prior to the 20:00 UTC mtg.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Versions updated in docs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and bollini's goal sounds good. If needed, we can push back final release slightly too...but we can see how things look next week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, the official mtg is ended here. But, I'll be around for a while if anyone has anything else to discuss</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks like the DCAT forum is members-only?  I will join, mention Ds-1631, and lurk.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I think DCAT mailing list is similar to other lists...all our lists actually require you join before you can post</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmmm... I *thought* anyone could join</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; This is the Google Group "DSpace Community Advisory Team".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yep. that's the right one.  Well, maybe Val had to lock it down for some reason.  In any case, you should be able to request membership and she'll add you right away.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Val's not online right now, or else I'd ask her. She controls the "keys" to that Google Group</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's what I did:  "apply for membership".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and it gave you a "permission denied"?  Ugh. We might need to email Val.  I don't have any access control in that group... I'm just a normal "member".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There is "contact the owner".  Trying that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It didn't complain.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; just noting that they don't use the mailing list for discussions, only some announcements and planning. they do their discussions in their ~monthly phone calls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I presume that will straighten things out sometime soon.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; their mailing list though is still the best place to ping them about feedback on JIRA tickets..which is what mhwood is trying to do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I just want to get some DCAT attention onto Ds-1631.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[22:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;dspace_jvm&gt; where do we set the dspace jvm args</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hi dspace_jvm.. Are you talking about things like JAVA_OPTS ? i.e. how much memory to assign to dspace, or to run it in -server mode?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; typically these things are best done however your OS does these things. However, you can usually easily bump the amount of memory that your /dspace/bin/dspace script gets, by editing that file itself.</span><br />
