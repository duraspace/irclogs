<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; hi all. I'm having a really flaky network. fixed on using spare machine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; But.. 1.8.1 was released last week, correct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Apparently there are three here right now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, I believe 1.8.1 did release.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; ok, two features I've added recently, just to share the word. is that there is a StaticPage class in XMLUI for letting the XSL create a page. Nothing too special, but is now a possibility</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; And then, I've added a method to XMLUI Wing element's for form fields/inputs. So that they can say something like inputField.setAutoFocus("autofocus")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; ...to make the browser autofocus onto that field.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; I went through various pages that require user-input, and set the primary/first field in each of them to automatically take the focus.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; Once you have it, its kind of nice. i.e. you don't have to use mouse to activate the field</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That will be nice.  It takes forever to tab down to where one typically wants to start.  I've never had the patience....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Indeed that would be very nice :) (is the autofocus realse in DSpace 1.8.1. ? Or will it be 3.0 only ?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; it didn't get done for 1.8.1, just the 3.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That will be a nice user-visible improvement to highlight for v3.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; in some other news, I've been hacking our (local) statistics reports, and made a grid view for showing annual growth. <a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/115522466408243604820/albums/5403404115776252449/5688262624885627010?banner=pwa">https://plus.google.com/photos/115522466408243604820/albums/5403404115776252449/5688262624885627010?banner=pwa</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think static page improvement will be well received as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; The recent email from DCAT said they'd like to see more metadata.. i.e. bitstream metadata, and collection metadata. And the break apart the usage of namespaces. dc.identified.OhioStateUserID gets refactored to a non-dublin-core namespace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, there's a JIRA for the latter (not *yours*, but generally).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've been off work, but tinkering with a way to set up a different (non-pooled) DBMS connection for commandline parts of DSpace.  Nothing to show yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Reason:  I have random connection closure problems with commandline bits, and using a pool for a single session is unnecessary complexity.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-green">* sandsfish (~sandsfish@dhcp-18-111-9-139.dyn.mit.edu) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; That makes sense. So basically all DB connections go through DBManager, and going through that gives you a pooled connection?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.  But if I can supply a non-pooled connection through JNDI, I can get around that without touching DBManager.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; bin/dspace can make that JNDI provider the one consulted for initial context, and DBManager will just use it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; Would it perhaps be easier to create another constructor for DBManager that allows you to specify a non-pooled connection... and then alter all SomethingInvokedThroughLauncher.main things to use that non-pooled connection</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; I'm guessing you messing in this area know more than me.. I don't think I've touched JNDI directly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We don't go directly to DBManager, though.  Getting a handle on an object implicitly spins up the database .</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't recall the precise details, but I didn't see a good way to tell DBManager that it's running single-session.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt;  /sidenote Anyone with Ubuntu (development) boxes notice the recent change in availability in distributed java in partner repository? <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html">https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2011-December/001528.html</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Besides, I'd been wanting to write a JNDI provider and this one si simple enough for a first attempt.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'd been hearing similar things for other distro.s.  I've begun trying out OpenJDK but not in production yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It seems Oracle puts each release under some new variation of the license.  I've had enough of fetching and reading new license mutants.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's why I asked a while back about other experience with OpenJDK.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; yeah.. I was going to stick with my old mantra of just stick it out with sun-java. by some form of fetching it directly and installing it.. But I don't want to manage security updates myself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; so it becomes.. what _exactly_ is wrong with openJDK, and is there any chance we'll be able to squeek by on it.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oooh.  I think it might be less work to just pitch in on OpenJDK development where we have issues....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; That would be an interesting A/B profile test to work on. DSpace-A (running SunJava), and DSpace-B (running OpenJDK)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It looks as though XMLUI just fails to recheck task state when executing a request?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; concurrent editting.. yikes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; a-&gt;claim_task(taskID)-&gt;editMetadata()    .... then b-&gt;claim_task(taskID) should possibly give a notification that hey, this task is claimed by A, do you want to claim it too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well in the regular workflow 2 people shouldn't be able to claiml the same item (correct me if I am wrong)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The issue says that you can't CLAIM concurrently.  I think it says that XMLUI is trusting state information contained in the page it sent at some time in the past, and when I think about that it's clearly wrong.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The fact that a task was unclaimed when a page was generated says nothing about whether it is unclaimed when a new request comes in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; So anybody mind if I claim this one also ? Seems like an interesting bug to fix</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We're about out of time.  Should we stop the review here?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; sure. I have a SOLR question, that I just want to pose out loud</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Go ahead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can stay for a while.  Say on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I still  haven't gone beyond the introduction in that SOLR book, though....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Which book is that mhwood ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; My peoples want me to produce top visitors by domain. i.e. top .edu visiting domains.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; (Always interested to learn new solr stuff)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; may I get back to you on that?  I don't recall and it's not here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; i.e. 700 from hardvard.edu, 600 from mit.edu, 10000 from osu.edu, ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; the problem... is that you can't prefix a query with a wildcard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 370 from kcl.ac.uk, so one has to handle multiple suffix lengths.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; thus your facet can go crawler* to find crawler.msn.com crawler.jeeves.com, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; but you can't say *.edu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; or *.osu.edu</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; so.. the question is how would I go about altering my solr schema, to change dns from a string, to something that gets tokenized where each . period splits the token that solr indexes upon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; bc. I can change the schema, but to make the change affect the data, I got to reindex solr.. {insert ominous music}</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Completely out of my depth here, but my first guess is you need to write a small extension.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; Hey sorry guys, I logged in earlier and didn't see too many people, so I assumed we were off for the holiday.  Thanks to the few troopers still here!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Glad to have you here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; or... I'd like to store DNS information backwards. instead of peterdietz.lib.ohio-state.edu it would index/store it as edu.ohio-state.lib.peterdietz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well if you want to split up the DNS fields by . you could always use the PatternTokenizerFactory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; then I would facet upon edu.FIELD-I-CARE-ABOUT.*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Flipping would also work ofc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; are we solr 1.4 or solr 3</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Reversing the components still needs to tokenize DNS-style, so you have to solve that problem either way.  What you do with the results depends on what works best for you.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; The problem with leading wildcard is similar to looking in the back of a book to find entires that start with sci* versus entries that end with *ence</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; sci, you jump to the S's and find SCI...   ence, you have to review every single element in the index, to see if it matches ence.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Indirect evidence (rummaging in ~/.m2/repository) suggests that we're using Solr 1.4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; We have 10M+ documents in Solr stats, extremely impractical to run this query.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; Kevin, is there anything you've built that would help in reindexing solr stats?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; i.e. adding Bundle Name, required reindexing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; so.. my local need of adding field DNS_reverse would do similar.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Yes I was just gonna suggest that, for the Bundle Name reindexing we dropped the solr index in a csv file &amp; reuploaded these</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-599">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-599</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; You would have to delete the fields before reuploading though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Unless this is a one-time report, though, it may still be useful to get Lucene to handle new entries itself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; new entries, after i alter schema, and add code to add dns_reverse, should work automatically.. flipping the legacy data, requires the reindex</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; cool. This gives me some direction to tackle this. I don't know if it will be needed by others (dns_reverse). But I'll try to upload a patch once we're done with it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Indeed to reindex I would recommend looking into the JIRA I just gave, I looked at it a LOT &amp; this was the fastest way to do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; I think that was a very elegant solution. The typical alternative provided by "you need to reindex solr from your data source".. Umm our data source is several gigabytes of dspace.log files, and this reindex takes atleast a week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; but... we're past 2100UTC, so I'm guessing we can break off now..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I need some sleep anyways</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz_web&gt; cool, laters ya'll</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; If you require some further aid feel free to contact me Peter Dietz, I have a lot of experience with solr &amp; am always willing to share ;)</span><br />
