<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; While there are 37 tickets in that category, some of these simply need a "retest", some have a PR which needs testing, and some simply need docs.

<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Nonetheless, I feel we are getting close to a 6.0.  I'd hope most of these tickets should be resolvable rather quickly.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; ok.  In my testing I have not necessarily relied on this behavior, but it could be due to my authn method</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; For this one, I actually couldn't remember if this worked right in 5.x...or if this is a more "longstanding" known issue?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b3: good question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Where does it say that the submitter should be immune to embargo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Most of our submissions are done by repository admins, so I do not know if this is a current issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone know if this is just how embargo works?  If so, we should likely just leave this open and note that it's *also* a known issue in 4.x,5.x etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Essentially, if this existed in 4.x, 5.x, then I'd recommend we simply deschedule this from 6.0 (and wait for a volunteer to fix it).  But, if this is a newly broken issue, we probably should fix it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone willing to volunteer to investigate whether this bug also occurs in 4.x or 5.x?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I will run a test while we are meeting...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks terry-b3</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I suspect that this is actually a feature request, in that I expect it never worked the way the poster expects it to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yea, I'm starting to wonder if that's the case myself. If so, we can take it off our list for 6.0</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Has a PR, needs testing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, wait..this is that one from Georgetown that's had a lot of discussion :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; It would be great to have a test from someone.  This is Mike's first PR and I would love to see it merged.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; agreed, it'd be good to have a tester or two. I'd be glad to do a code reveiw (again won't happen till next week though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b3: does testing this just involve doing an AIP import? Or is it a specialized import of some sort?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; It is an AIP import.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I was about to ask the same thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; There may be some details about how authority policies are named</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; cause it sounds like you just need an AIP export from a 5.x instance...then import it into 6.x and see if it works?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; This was a port of a 5x solution into 6x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; pretty sure 6x AIP restore works, but I'll look into it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, I understand. I was just trying to help out testers...let them know how to test this exactly :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: sounds good. I'll let you have this one then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Sorry... my comment applied to his other PR.  This one was a 6x issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b3: If you or he can add a comment on the steps to test the PR, it might be helpful. I *think* they are just: (1) Export AIP from 5.x, (2) Try to import it to 6.x.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Is there anything special about the handles that trigger the problem?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; does it *have* to be exported from 5.x?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: not sure...but it sounds like that's what he did when he encountered this (according to the ticket description &amp; first comment)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Export from instance 1 that uses one handle pattern.  Import into another instance using a different pattern.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, that's why I was asking for more docs on how to replicate &amp; test it.  We need more details :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; By "different pattern" you mean the two instances have different prefixes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; We pull prod handles into our test instance but need ot preserve the prod handles</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; They have different handle prefixes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And that's what triggers the problem?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; The terminology on this may not be standard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I believe so.  I will ask Mike to provide the definitive details</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK... so... totally different handles are OK? I can grab some AIPs from MOspace and try to load them into my dev instance, that'll be interesting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks terry-b3. I think a step by step example that can replicate this scenario (from Mike) would help us out</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This is one I investigated last week, but hadn't gotten back to.  Bitstream editing from XMLUI doesn't work at all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It seems to be a UUID related issue (see my comment). I haven't had time to get back to this though (and won't until next week)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My suspicion is this is a tiny bug... as it seems to be trying to treat the Format ID (which is an Int) as a UUID somewhere in the XMLUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If anyone wants it, feel free to claim it..otherwise, I'll try to get back to it sometime next week if I can</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This is a display issue with author authorities... it affects *both* JSPUI and XMLUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Re 3157, I believe I saw this when I had authorities enabled.  Does the issue resolve itself after re-indexing or after running the authority management command line tasks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b3: unaware of this "resolving itself".  It exists on demo.dspace.org right now though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Is that the one that displays *some* names and *some* keys?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; although it looks like demo.dspace.org is down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yes... Some author names display right...it almost seems like names *later in the list* suddenly switch to keys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So it may indeed be indexing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; terry-b3: maybe we can investigate the ORCID setup on demo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; Does demo run all of the nightly cron tasks?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, as far as I'm aware 3157 has no resolution.  But, if someone knows of one (if it is just an indexing issue), then that'd be good to document (and close the ticket)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I was just thinking that perhaps a cron job was missed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; demo does run nightly tasks...not sure if it has *all* the cron jobs, but it should.  It is possible we forgot one though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, essentially 3157 needs a volunteer to investigate if this is demo specific, or if it really is a bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;terry-b3&gt; I am just suggesting it as a possible solution.  I no longer have it configured.  I feel like I should include something in "quotes"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; added a note to 3157 that it needs retesting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we've run out of time today.  We didn't make it through all the tickets...and unfortunately, I cannot stick around much longer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm going to have to leave.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, we'll stop at 3157 today.  I'd encourage everyone to please go through this list and claim a few tickets (to test, re-test, document or fix, based on status).
