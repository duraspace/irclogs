<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; would probably be a useful statistic to track, especially for self-submit repositories</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I do agree that it seems like something useful to track.  I think mhwood is right that we need a new event to track this</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, agreed mdiggory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; We already need to add new UsageEvents for searches</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The UI can be more mobile friendly.  The content may be intractable, but that's not reason not to let people try.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory: could be.  Dunno, it's worth looking into</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; An Ipad (or Fire) is technically a mobile platform, but its display capacity is more like a desktop.  Wouldn't a mobile theme look weird on such devices?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- not always.  I have a Kindle Fire.  By default it does use the regular Web UIs.

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  We'll stop JIRA review there for today.  I'm assuming KevinVdV will let us know if he needs help on Ds-1020 at a later date (since he's not here right now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I bow to the more extensive experience of others.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I think the responsive design stuff worries about all that (in CSS etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; agreed richardrodgers. A mobile UI can just be a different CSS on existing HTML, if your HTML is "clean enough".  It need not actually be a separately generated HTML page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; TBH... with all the various reference manager apps that are emergent, etc... maybe we should be focused on integration with those services more than browsing in DSpace like it was a mobile app.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; its one of the options...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; actually I use google scholar primarily with sente</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well -- I guess the question is "what else can we do to integrate with stuff like sente, if we are already optimizing Dspace for Google Scholar &amp; similar"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think the same stuff we do for zotero etc, embedded rdfa, mircoformats, coins, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, I'd agree with looking more at implementing more microformats -- start up a jira ticket! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Actually, I think getting the DSpace metadata into PDF metadata would go a really long way in this environement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DSpace metadata -&gt; PDF metadata?  How?  Wouldn't that involve actually dynamically changing/modifying/creating PDFs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I think he meant RDF</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; no, I meant altering the PDF</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh,  yea. RDF makes more sense :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes.... literally altering the PDF (OMG... Noooo)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think that leaves too many chances for corruption to be honest.  If we did that, we'd need to keep the original in-tact</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ooh, on the fly munging, cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; Oh, I misheard mdiggory - we do enhance PDFs with metadata</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; for certain content</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; out of curiousity, what software do you use to do that enhancement?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; just request a PDF in the Open Access collection - we programmatically insert a front page to the PDF</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well -- it sounds like others are interested in this.  Wondering out loud if this is something we should think about releasing a "plugin" to DSpace for?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- I agree. I'm +1 this idea, as long as you are still preserving the original.  I only get nervous if you replace the original with something "programmatically" created</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. mdiggory, would you be willing to create an initial ticket? (Since you started this discussion thread)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm currently looking right at richardrodgers mds (modern DSpace) on another screen, and the readme mentions metadata for all objects</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; helix84: I noted that also - in my experiments (mds) its all in the existing metadatavalue table</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes, this is something we have used in some @mire projects and is used behind some of our addons that need to record metadata on bitstreams</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: what's the reason for a separate table?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; And richardrodgers and I have chatted about that approach too, I think all options are on the table at this point, they all have various benefits</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- yea, currently we have two implementations of Metadata 4 All (neither of which has received final committer approval, yet).  There's Mark's version (in pull request #12) and Richard's version in MDS (<a href="https://github.com/richardrodgers/mds)">https://github.com/richardrodgers/mds)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; because its an addon for DSpace and a separate table reduces interference with the existing API and other apps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; We could have written it without overriding DSO's entirely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; whereas in my case, I'm breaking the API anyway, so non-interference isn't so important...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: sorry, i don't unerstand what you mean by addon in this context</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I do like a more common table approach.... but also, I've talked some with both tdonohue and richardrodgers about a need for being able to "group" metadata into sections.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; helix84: this was originally an override of the dspace-api to support @mire addons.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; personally, I'm not against going towards a more "common table" approach.  As this is such a big feature, I think others won't mind if we break some APIs here or there in order to fully support it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hey, it's a .0 release -- things can be broken if they must be.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (plus, in the long term, it makes more sense to move towards a "common table" --  it seems odd to have to look in different areas for different types of metadata)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 mhwood -- as long as we provide a migration path for current data</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'm also in favor of a single table, but i also wanted to talk about another possible aproach</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I will note that the Item Level Versioning proposal stores metadata for all Item Versions in the metadatavalue table (given that all Versions are true Items)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i needed to run some one time SQL queries agains metadatavalue and every time I do that these queries get very complicated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; not impossible, just very complicated and ineffective</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; note that in this case Versioning is more like  "Editioning"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i asked about it at some #sql channels and such and the database guys immediately recognized that it's EAV and insisted I shouldn't use EAV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; helix84: can you give us the usecase?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, give me a minute to let me dig into my notes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; do you mean... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93attribute%E2%80%93value_model</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; anyway, meanwhile you can take a look at one of the suggestions they gave me - hstore: <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/hstore.html">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/hstore.html</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; really nice, but no equivalent in oracle</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; is reminded of an offline dialog with tdonohue about getting metadata out of the db and into Bitstreams....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; another option would be getting metadata into NoSQL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hstore is actually NoSQL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but then I was also thinking maybe that's why you also put metadata into SOLR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but I don't know how to write complex SQL-like queries in SOLR syntax</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; you try not to attempt that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; What problem are we trying to solve here?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Efficiency is the query optimizer's job.  Give it the indices it needs and let it work for you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; joins on EAV table</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; generally you flatten your data into solr to support using it for its search and factting capabilities.  there is some experimental new work with joining solr queries, but you won't see the same capabilities as a db</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; huh. hadn't heard of PostgreSQL hstore -- it reminds me of stuff in the Ruby on Rails world (as I've seen similar DB structures there, where you can stick structured data in a single DB field).</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll admit, I'm not "connecting" all the dots here.  But, it *sounds* interesting.  I just need a more concrete example or two somewhere :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; my thoughts are that metadata comes in more forms than EAV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; interesting discussion, but I have to run. I'll read the IRC log</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will note though that I don't think we can just "cut off Oracle support".  I do think these ideas seem very interesting to explore, but we need to avoid being PostgreSQL specific.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea. currently, we are storing the preserved content (or metadata at least) in the DB, but our "cache" is Solr (or similar).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; if you try to run this kind of query on real-world size data, it will take some time :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, I get that.  Just not sure I get how hstore/NoSQL would make this sort of query *easier*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; good point, i don't remember right now :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and also whether hstore/NoSQL could also make other queries/metadata management easier -- I think if we can make a good case for why/how it simplifies things in the DB, then we'd have a better chance of convincing other Committers why it would be a worthwhile direction.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm glad you are thinking about this helix84 and glad you brought it up.  It's just we probably need to all better understand why/how it could work with our current data model</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Theres something similar to this in Solr called Field Collapsing... it would group duplicates on a specific field by value</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i think if you try to solve the problem of finding duplicate values, you'll see the current disadvantages. the rest is just suggestions for now, no recommendations.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: but i need to know the item ids of those duplicates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aren't item ids in Solr too? If they aren't they could also be indexed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; what i meant is if you do "group by", i think you can lose ids (or any other columns) of the grouped items</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; don't know what the case is in SOLR, though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I actually don't know either, to be honest.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In general though, I like the idea of doing *less SQL queries* in DSpace.  I think there'd be two approaches -- one is to rely more heavily on Solr for indexing content (and only touch the DB when content needs to *change*), the other could be something like NoSQL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; to sum up, the problem with storing metadata is that EAV tables are bad for complex SQL queries, and the reason we use EAV is that we need a way to be flexible with metadata schemas.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, good summary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i hope you don't mind that i hijacked the conversation with just the problem and no tested solution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; metadata bitstreams looking kinda pretty good right now :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, well, meeting is obviously well into "overtime" here.  Several folks already had to head out. So, there's no more "official discussion", but feel free to hang around or leave as you need to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: i don't see why. queries would be only slower...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- not at all. I think it's a good brainstorm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think if you went with metadata bitstreams, you'd have to still index that metadata in something like Solr --&gt; so queries would end up being via Solr</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* helix84 really needs to study up on solr queries</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i.e. I think we'll always likely want two main things when it comes to metadata :  (1) the preserved metadata (could be in a more static place like a bitstream, or in a dynamic place like a DB), and (2) the cached / indexed / searchable metadata (can be indexed in such a way that it becomes more highly searchable, like in Solr or similar)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, the *preserved* location need not be the same place as the *searchable* location</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: correct, that's where we're heading anyway, is my take on this discussion, so, we have a "cache" of the metadata in solr, or something else (NoSQL?), and the metatdata can be as crazy as it wants to be.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: i remember now, you wanted bitstreams because of _structured_ metadata</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger just wants happier users... :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, and users these days seem to want *structured* metadata ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we must have different users, mine only bitch about content, not DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (or at least the repository managers seem to)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; correct, my definition of "user" may differ from others, my job is to keep librarians happy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, yea. There are two levels of users :  The repository managers/librarians (who often care about metadata &amp; structured metadata), and the end users (who just want to submit content into the system &amp; don't really care about metadata)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; IMHO dspace metadata currently has just the right balance between structure and being able to query it. When you introduce more complex structure into metadata, your search has to _know_ about that structure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I agree with that helix84.  But, at the same time, DSpace currently cannot easily support things like "author affiliations" without more structured metadata.  Essentially, "dublin core" like structures can be a little too simplistic at times, which is why more structured, XML-based metadata schemas (like MODS) came about</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84, I think I tend to agree, I like the current approach (I do like SQL, probably mostly because it's a skill already in my toolbox), but we're getting friction where the approach doesn't fit with what we're being asked to do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i was thinking of just the same use case - authors + urls</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; alas, interesting discussion, but I've gotta go pick up kids</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; will catch up on the transcripts later, by all!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I unfortunately have to leave in a bit too. But the discussion is very interesting.  In any case, the repository managers are starting to request things that they see in MODS (like author affiliations or similar), and DSpace just cannot support them easily</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so, what would a search look like with simple metadata like this: &lt;author&gt;&lt;name&gt;Doe, John&lt;/name&gt;&lt;affiliation&gt;ABC&lt;/affiliation&gt;&lt;/author&gt;?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; whereas, if we could support MODS / XML metadata, then we'd be in a much better place.  But, as stated about, it will mean that DSpace would need to know how to index this type of metadata so that it could be searchable/browseable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 - I think in that case, you could index all that in Solr, and then be able to search by author or by affiliation.  Solr is a very powerful search engine that can create many different facets</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; exactly, how do you express the relations in Solr (or a relational DB)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so in solr you can search by author name and get author name + affiliation?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In Solr, you express them as indexes.  You can define new indexes in your Solr schema &amp; then essentially index metadata coming from an external source into those Solr indexes. But, my Solr is a bit rusty.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, once you setup the Solr indexes &amp; then index content.  You can then construct queries that say stuff like: "give me everything that has an author who's affiliation is "ABC"" and Solr will return it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; 1) it's nice it can do that 2) i think here's the problem i wanted to point out - you would neex to set up indexes in a way to reflect your structure - which you don't know in advance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; for #2, you actually *do* know the metadata structure as long as you limit it to some standards, e.g. MODS and similar.  You are correct though that we'd never be able to say "we support all XML structured metadata".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so along with each structured metadata format you would also need to define the structure of solr indexes (to reflect the groups and relations)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The solr indexes are actually independent of the structure of the external metadata.  There's an Indexer class (in Java) that actually would need to do the translation from an external MODS metadata (or DC metadata) into the existing Solr Indexes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; the hard part would be to determine the proper Solr indexes that "generally cover" the main metadata field types that we are wanting to deal with (e.g. title, author, author affiliation, subject, etc etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; you're losing me a bit here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but it's because i don't understand solr well enough</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, essentially, you'd need to dig into solr more.  Essentially, a Solr index is more generic thing -- some samples could be "title", "author", "author affiliation", "subject".</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, when you actually perform *indexing* of metadata, you'd need to write a Java class that says:  The metadata field: &lt;author&gt;&lt;name&gt;Doe, John&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/author&gt; should be stored in the Solr index "author"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i would understand if you expressed it as data structures</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Similarly, you could say the metadata field: &lt;author&gt;&lt;affiliation&gt;ABC&lt;/affiliation&gt;&lt;/author&gt; gets indexed in the Solr index named "author affiliation"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yeah, you currently set up these mappings in dspace.cfg. since in structured metadata it could be more compliceted, you would do the mappings with code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; there would always be a need to map, its generally easiest to map to the Solr XML document format,  that might make it clearer...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; what is Solr XML document format? link please?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; correct, helix84.  In fact, Discovery already does some of that mapping.  It maps DSpace DB metadata fields into Solr indexes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; SOlr does support mapping via xslt, but I've just used xslt outside of Solr to create Solr Documents and then post them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll let mdiggory take over -- he's done more Solr than I recently ;)   Plus, I need to run here in a bit.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: where can i see these discovery mappings?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm here but have to do another meeting...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; no problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- they are in the discovery codebase.  Not sure of the exact classes off the top of my head</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DSpace Discovery - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Discovery">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Discovery</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It looks like the org.dspace.discovery.SolrServiceImpl class does the main Indexing for Discovery (see the indexContent() methods)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thats under dspace-discovery/dspace-discovery-solr/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, admittedly, it's using the Solr Java API.  So you may need to also look at that to understand how it is working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; The configuration of which metadata fields are inserted into which facets / indexes is in the Spring configuration.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, that metadata field mapping (in Spring) looks to be in /dspace-discovery/dspace-discovery-provider/src/main/resources/spring/spring-dspace-addon-discovery-configuration-services.xml</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Think of this as sort of an ORM strategy... Item / Solr / View mapping</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and mdiggory knows how this works much better than I -- I'm just digging in code right now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it seems the main thing there is buildDocument(), but i'll have to look up what that does</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; buildDocument() is actually in that same SolrServiceImpl class &amp; it looks like it loads the configs from the Spring config that I mentioned above</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; note, we use a great deal of wildcard fields in the actual solr schema... its best to dig into the solr admin UI to see what is actually there, it can be accessed inside the solr webapp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mdiggory: yes, i've looked at it before</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; correct, the spring config is used on both indexing and querying...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, gotta go.  Been a good discussion though.  Bye</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; do you mean spring-dspace-addon-discovery-configuration-services.xml? but that's just facets and such, not mapping metadata to indexes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bye tim</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; its a description of how to index the metadata fields so that the term completion, faceting and other features operate well on both string and date fields...</span><br />
