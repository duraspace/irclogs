<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm planning to write a small addition which will delete null user records</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; based on that feedback, I'd be +1 putting this in for 4.0, assuming we can get some docs.  We'll get plenty of testing/improvements along the way</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; To me, "Private items" seem like AuthZ issues popping up again.  Essentially, "private items" in DSpace are difficult cause our AuthZ policies are a bit "all over" (i.e. build into UIs rather than in a "business logic layer")</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; actually also "published" (in_archive) and withdrawn are technical hint and not real state. We don't have a getState method or a State ENUM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm still not sure I understand why "private items" are a "hint".  Doesn't "private" essentially mean they are "access controlled" (i.e. limited access to only specific users/groups)?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Not really controlled.  More like, "we won't tell you it's there, but if you know it is then you can get it."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we need to decide how to mange it... I think private item as un-discoverable item (as said in the hint of the submission)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: exactly, this is also how I understand them (and I see some useful use case for that)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: but wouldn't that be better called a "hidden item"?  (i.e. if you know the full URL, it's actually public...but, it's not easy to get that full URL).   Maybe my whole confusion here is that "private" means something very specific in my mind</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's really kind of anonymous access for those who know.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree that I would not have used the word "private".</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So this is just making SOLR aware of something we already had?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Right, Discoverable makes more sense to me.  It's either easily discoverable, or it's hidden.  But, either way, these items are still technically *public* (i.e. they don't require special authorization -- they are just hard to find)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; not only solr... we need a lot of changes to make all things working well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The pull, though, seems to be a one-liner dealing with SOLR.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; OAI-PMH needs to be fixed (as we will go to separate discoverable from withdrawn)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: yes the pull is really easy it technical work but it is conceptual  wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So do we want to *not* pull it now, but work out a better method?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; what part is "conceptually wrong"?   Guess I'm still trying to understand which parts *work* and which parts are broken.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The voices are telling me that discoverable, withdrawn, etc. should be done using finer-grained ACLs, once we have them.  That's not a quick path, though.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Just wondering in my head why "embargo" even uses "hidden/private items".  If something is under embargo, it's *access restricted*.  It's true that it also should not be discoverable...but even if it was discoverable, you should not be able to see it unless you have proper authorization.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it was related to latest introduction of right control in discovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, I'm starting to wonder if this whole "isDiscoverable" thing is a *hack* to get around a lack of a good AuthZ system in Dspace.  In other words, if we had a "good" AuthZ system, when something is under embargo (or access restricted) it also should not be discoverable via Discovery/REST/OAI/etc.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: I think the answer to that question is...  I though that for embargoes, a "private item" was meant to be an "access restricted item".  It's correct that we should NOT be displaying a "withdrawn item" page (it should instead display a page saying "this item is under embargo").  But, at the same point in time, if something is under embargo, you shouldn't be able to get to it by knowing the exact URL (you should always get a</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; but if the item is under embargo you don't need to mark it as private</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm worried here we are conflating / confusing two different things...  Embargoes (which require access restrictions), and this concept of "hidden items" (ones which are not discoverable, but are still accessible if you know the exact URL)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; if you set the policy of the embargo on the bitstream and/or on the item accordly all work well! if you mark the item as private actually you just broke the embarg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; when the embargo is expired on a private item actually you are not able to access it. I don't think that this is working well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, yea, that's a bug then.  When embargoes expire, the item should be accessible.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It should be *accessible*.  *Discoverable* seems to be another dimension.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not arguing here that the embargo functionality is "bug free".  I'm just arguing that I don't think the definition you provide for "private items" is the same definition that the Advanced Embargo functionality has for "private items"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, to be clear, I actually *do* like the Item State document you've written, bollini.  I think it's great.  I just think your definition for "private items" is something that is a *new feature*, and we might want to call it "hidden items" or something to avoid confusion with Embargo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: yes. Sorry probably I'm not clear. I agree with the definition (=hint) of the advanced embargo functionality but this is not what the embargo functionality actually do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the private flag is not really required by the advanced embargo functionality... we don't need it. Actually it is only a way to mark an item in submission for withdrawning just before publish it. But if this is the intention we should not duplicate the withdrawn flag</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; This is also tangled with differing interpretations of "embargo".  Some want it to mean discoverable but not readable; others want it to mean not discoverable or readable.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; we are able to manage discoverable also playing with read permission on the item</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: you might be right.  My definition of embargo = "not discoverable nor readable".  But, once the embargo period is ended, the item becomes both discoverable &amp; readable (assuming no other limiting access restrictions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; wait... if you set the item READ permission with a start date you will get what you say without set the private item flag</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I've got a Repo Manager following along with this discussion now, and she's proposing that we just drop the "private" flag from the interface on our repository</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: I think I'm better understanding.  I'd agree that it seems like "isDiscoverable" may not be needed by the Advanced Embargo functionality, if you can manage the discoverability via read permissions.  I guess I wonder why that "isDiscoverable" flag is there then -- is it a "hack" to get around an issue somewhere? Was it a mistake to add?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; most probably it was introduced to hide item also in the browse system... but also this is not really necessary as we now have the SOLRBrowseDAO that is right aware as well</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; so, my final opinion is: we have make a wrong to introduce this flag... now we can decide if we should remove it or make it useful (that is what was described in the embargo hint)</span><br />

(2) Advanced Embargo actually may not need to be using the "isDiscoverable" flag. Rather it should be able to manage discoverability via access restrictions (in order to set embargos).

<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini:  I'm OK with redefining what this "isDiscoverable" flag means, but we'd need to do it in stages: (1) first change Embargo to no longer be dependent on "isDiscoverable" flag (2) then, redefine "isDiscoverable" and implement a new feature around it.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; yes it call the isDiscoverable code because it is the step that enable also the use of this feature. But you don't need to use it to make use of the cool things of the advanced  embargo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Right.  So, what I meant was that (1) First we need to make sure the Embargo doesn't call the isDiscoverable code anymore.  (2) Then we can redefine what "isDiscoverable" means, and create a new feature around it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; My whole issue here is that we cannot just *redefine* "isDiscoverable", if it's being called by the Embargo code.

<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: I agree too... we should strip out the word "private item" and talk about discoverable (but I need to use it in terminology because we are trying to fix it ;-) )</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: my other concern is that if someone has used the private items features as it is now, changing the behavior we will make accessible some item that now are effectively withdrawn</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, it might be good to clarify then when you are talking about "private item" (as defined by Advanced Embargo), versus the "fixed" version (which is more a "discoverable item" or "hidden item").  Sometimes I find it hard to tell which version we are talking about (Advanced Embargo "private items" or the "non-discoverable items" you are suggesting)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; private item are defined by the Advanced Embargo as the discoverable item... but the advanced embargo don't implement the thing as it says</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: I think we'd need a migration path.  if someone has used the "private items" as they currently stand, then those would need to be migrated to a more proper "state" (whether that state is "embargoed" or "non-discoverable" or something else)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the most conservative path could be move "old private item" in the withdrawn state</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: I think my question about which version of "private items" we are talking about is related to the fact that I don't fully understand how Advanced Embargo functionality currently implements them, versus how you feel they actually should be implemented</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, it might be worth trying to describe that better somewhere (or at least describe what you understand so far, and others can help too)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, overall, I do think the "Item State Definitions" document you've written is a great start</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; current implementation is just mark the item withdrawn and add an additional flag (so that as administrator you have two separated list)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I understand what it says there... but, I think that definition is rather "vague".

<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; yes... but actually it mean the item will be withdrawn</span><br />
