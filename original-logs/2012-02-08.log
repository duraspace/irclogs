<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; if you type letters in, it'll jump to a title starting with those letters, and keep scope to current author</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, I see. I didn't quite understand at first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, what's the expected behaviour?  I'd assume both should browse to a *title* within this author list?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or do others disagree?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i think the jspui is more of a pure 'browse authors' behaviour</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; let me double check</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The context is "browse by author", so I would expect typein or click-a-letter to further filter by title.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Anyway, the text widget or the letter-links should do the same thing, whatever that is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; on demo.dspace.org JSPUI  both the "Jump to" links and the textbox seem to filter on *title* once you are browsing by a specific author/subject (unless I'm mistaken)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; and they both filter the list of authors/subjects before you select one (or if you go 'back')</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would find it surprising to be bounced out of the single-author context that I'd just carefully selected.  OTOH I would expect to find a link or button or whatever to take me back to the author list, and I haven't seen it yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; on demo.dspace.org XMLUI only the *textbox* filters appropriately on *title* once you are browsing by a specific author/subject</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd, correct.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh, there it is in the box on the right:  browse by...authors.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the only part that is broken is that the XMLUI "Jump to" links filter by *author or subject* when you are already browsing by a specific author/subject</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; so sounds like we all think xmlui should behave like jspui? just make sure the clickylinks keep scope in 2nd level?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree:  like JSPUI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 kshepherd -- I think JSPUI is acting appropriately.  XMLUI is not</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 1108 at least seems worth a point release.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, containers are small objects, I'll live with it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yea, it's an unfortunate reality. I've tried ways to get around re-generating container AIPs.  but, DSpace is more of the issue here.  So far, I just "live with it" as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- is Ds-910 fix on Trunk currently?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or is it already in 1.8.x branch too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Only trunk @ the moment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Since it was unclear if there would be a DSpace 1.8.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. yea, it sounds like Ds-910 could also be a candidate to backport to 1.8.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; re:sequenceID.... Does the AIP get the bundle2bitstream.bitstream_order? Because, I think we've switched to using bitstream_order to represent order (instead of sequenceID)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: Just noticed that *exact* issue today. I think that's also a problem in AIPs currently, as sorting by "bitstream_order" essentially sometimes leaves the order as "random" (as most Bitstreams have a bitstream_order=-1, unless specified)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: But, I'm still trying to debug that issue. It's another one that may need to be in a 1.8.2 release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; AIPs currently have issues with bitstream ordering, as currently default DSpace is configured to use "bitstream_order" field for ordering, but by default "bitstream_order" always is -1  (unless I'm mistaken)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (or unless I failed to upgrade my DSpace properly -- if so, let me know)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; actually wait -- I now see the upgrade script is supposed to set 'bitstream_order = sequence_id"  Maybe this is a mistake on my end</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in any case, AIPs have a bug here as well, which needs to be fixed for 1.8.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, do others generally agree that a 1.8.2 is warranted?  It sounds like we all do?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; +1 agree</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; +1 (plus I might also have another issue not mentioned yet but needs more investigating)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd be fine with "cutting" the 1.8.2 release myself. But, I'm wondering what folks think would be a good timeline?  1.8.2 on Feb 17?  Feb 24?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. I'll just say 1.8.2 release on Feb 24 -- deadline for bugfixes by end of day Feb 20.  I can post this to dspace-commit &amp; dspace-devel as well, so that others know they can get in bug fixes before then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll also ping robint on this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, next topic:  "DSpace Developers Virtual Summit".  Most of you likely already read some about this from my brainstorms to dspace-commit.  More brainstorms on the agenda topic: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2012-02-08">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2012-02-08</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Generally, I just wanted to see if others felt this is a good idea, and whether you'd try to attend or not?  Or if you had suggestions on *where* it be held (currently thinking about a Google+ Video Hangout, but that requires Google+)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I take it that Skype wouldn't serve?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm "+1" to Google+ hangout</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; Google+ hangouts have a max capacity, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; isn't it 10 or so?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 10</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- for some reason I thought Skype Video Chat required a pay acct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, G+ hangouts has a limit of 10.  The idea is that this summit would be *every day* for a week.  So, if you couldn't get in one day, you could join the next instead</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd has more of a "radio face" anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (why do we need video?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; but hangouts are cool :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we don't need video..just a thought.  we could do just voice (and G+ hangouts also works for just voice)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; if you have a piece of tape over your camera, or no camera plugged in, then you show up as your icon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Dunno, I'm just being stick-in-the-mud -- I finally had to install Skype, used it *once*, and I hate accumulating "kitchen gadgets" that only get used once a year....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; +1 to G+ I'm unsure we'd hit the max, I *can* do skype, but have only used it once</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Does anybody know if google+ will work on IPad ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; essentially, the idea here is to find a way to get a group of us *together* virtually and brainstorm out next steps for Dspace.  Currently the only time we manage to do this is at OR most years.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure, KevinVdV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's a worthwhile experiment.  Now I need to ask the boss for a microphone at least....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; mhwood, if you need one in a pinch, most headphones work as microphones, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; if Skype ends up being the "lowest common denominator" I'm fine with that as well.  I was more wanting to poll all of you to see if you'd tried G+ and are willing to experiment with a Hangout</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; First time I would have had a reason to use it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I have skype but I'm happy to try out a G+ Hangout</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/penguin-paparazzi-small.jpg">http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/penguin-paparazzi-small.jpg</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We've tried G+ hangouts internally for DuraSpace and they seem to work well. The one limitation I can think of is that sometimes the video is not as good from a Linux OS (unfortunately). But, as mentioned, you can also do just audio</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; you can say hangouts on linux are bad... I would say skype call's on linux are terrible..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I've heard that Skype is bad on Linux too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (or at least, very outdated)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. I'm going to assume G+ Hangout is fine, unless I hear otherwise :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so.. hangout it is.. It would be good to get some virtual-face-to-face time.. Because at real-life meetings, I think the first thing we do is start talking about how much we should be talking more.. so video-conf is a good idea.. With kshepherd's face for radio, he'll keep the tape over the camera. ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 PeterDietz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Also, as a sidenote: I am not going to make OR12 this year (unfortunately, I have a family conflict -- my brother is getting married).  So, this will be the only time I may see many of your "shining faces" this year.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and, if this idea pans out, we could have several of these "Virtual Summits" each year (e.g. every 3-6 months, as we feel they are needed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; if it doesn't pan out, then we will never speak of it again (a joke) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Family comes first.  Congratulations to your brother and his bride.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; At this point, I'm leaning towards holding this Virtual Summit the week of Feb 27 - Mar 2, unless anyone is aware of major conflicts (big conferences/events) that week?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I'm signed up to Google+</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm still looking at our budget and I'm not sure it'll fit in the budget... (the big expense is all the scotch I was planning to buy/consume)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; vote on GitHub is 2/29, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, yea. vote on GitHub is 2/29.  Hmmm...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; PeterDietz: OR12, budget woes, yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger_ crossing his fingers for a July budget miracle.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd say we run GitHub vote virtually, on dspace-devel?  I'm hesitant to do this Summit the week before (Feb 20-24) as I've now just scheduled 1.8.2 for that week :)  I cannot do the Mar 5 week as I have several conflicts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Unless we just swap Summit to Feb 20-24 and do 1.8.2 on Mar 2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any thoughts/preferences here?  Otherwise I'll just make a decision and send it out to dspace-commit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; may be a good way to hash out any lingering concerns re: GitHub; and it would be nice to have 1.8.2 out the door, instead of tempting ourselves with "one last fix" idea from the summit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; github vote can run on the mailing list. I don't think that cutting the release should impact the summit. You can go into busy mode while you're having maven churn for its 20 minute process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; good thinking hpottinger_</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, 1.8.2 will be Feb 24.  Summit will be Feb 27-Mar 2.  GitHub vote will be virtual (but concerns can be brought up in Summit as needed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Last topic (more of just an announcement):  DuraSpace will be applying for Google Summer of Code 2012 again.  So, please start brainstorming any GSoC Student project ideas, and start to think about whether you'd be interested in mentoring a project of your choice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll be updating our GSoC wiki area in the next few days: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/</a>  I'll make sure to send out a notice once it is ready for folks to start entering in some project ideas, etc</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I noticed richard rodgers made another commit to MDS.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I forked it, and started going in a different direction. I haven't tried "running" his most recent changes.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- so is your direction in conflict with what he started?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; no, he's got some grander visions, and he's doing good in implementing them. I took more of a "something broke", "lets revert to fix"..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; for instance he's changing command launcher to be able to be configurable from the DB.. without having to push new code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, i see.  Yea, from chatting with richardrodgers, I think he's taking a change things "radically" approach, and fix things later as he goes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, maybe this all means we need to try and bring MDS ideas/visions into a more public area or something?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (admittedly, I don't know richardrodgers' larger ideas either -- just have been excited to actually see someone going in and cleaning up those areas that we sometimes haven't touched in a while)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think mds being small makes for an easier playground. It is interesting.. you could rachet up some bigger changes with less overhead.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ...or in richards case, get to a working prototype of &lt;insert-new-change&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger_&gt; I wonder if Richard would consider blogging the process (or is he already?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; but good meeting. I imagine we'll need to advertise that there will be a developer summit in about 1.5 weeks time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; you could always ask?  I think he's really currently just logging/detailing everything in MDS in the README on this page: <a href="https://github.com/richardrodgers/mds">https://github.com/richardrodgers/mds</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; also, I will be looking for possible larger topics or questions to "seed" the developer summit discussion with (agendas will be "open" though and we'll talk about whatever attendees want to).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if anyone has some topics they'd like to see, feel free to send my way (I'll also post this to dspace-commit and folks can respond there)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; sidenote: having your DSpace database connected to solid state hard drive makes for wicked fast queries. I usually would never do something like "select * from metadatavalue;" in pgadmin...  because it would take several seconds.. it can finish in less than one second now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But it still takes an hour to read it....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm usually pretty lazy, so I'll use graphical query builder to spit out the "select * ..." portion, and then edit that to do something like where text_value like '% - %'</span><br />
