<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; barmintor: regarding fcrepo-1102, it sounds like it would be ok to remove the pid regexes @Paths as long as we can ensure that the mapping is working right, then. I was planning on doing a test of each method with/without %3A in place of the pid namespace delimiter (":"), so it seems if I can get that to pass, we're golden.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; ...right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; cwilper: I think so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; good enough for me at this point. I'll give it a shot and see what happens, then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; it's possible that the status code for a malformed pid changes from a 404 to a 500</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; I'm actually kind of surprised that these params aren't decoded before being matched</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; in fact, <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-basics.html">http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-basics.html</a> says that they are decoded</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Apache CXF -- JAX-RS Basics ] - <a href="http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-basics.html">http://cxf.apache.org/docs/jax-rs-basics.html</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; cwilper: You might want to keep the code more or less intact, and just swap in a different value for VALID_PID_PART</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; b/c this CXF documentation is all suggesting that the params are decoded first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; right. there are some cases where VALID_PID_PART isn't used, like for getObjectExport though. Yes, I found that odd...the correct behavior is for the JAX-RS impl to decode the param value, but I wonder if that step is getting skipped by CXF because it's using a regex. I hunted for bug reports and couldn't find anything.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; cwilper: getObjectExport is not using it because of developer error :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; , ahh: the old PICNIC bug: problem in chair, not in computer   . Well that's easy enough to fix. The other place it's not used is at the top of DatastreamResource. Maybe I can refer to the constant there if I make it public (actually, it should probably be in BaseRestResource instead of FedoraObjectsResource, eh?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; Yeah.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; cwilper: It's also possible that CXF is being smart about this to our detriment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; since a ':' is a valid character for a path segment</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; Ahh, maybe the regex matching is happening on the non-decoded version of the path segment. So using %3A instead of ":" means no matching method is found.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; I'll try to figure out if that's the case now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; Sure enough, looking at the server log, I see (JAXRSUtils) No operation matching request path "/fedora/objects/test%3ASomeObject" is found, Relative Path: /test%3ASomeObject, HTTP Method: GET, ContentType: */*, Accept: */*,...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; cwilper: so then the follow-up question is whether that path segment is decoded in the body of the method (if it's matched)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; yep. i tweaked the regex to allow for %3A and %3a, and I'm testing that now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; The answer is yes. So just tweaking the regex fixes it. I'm inclined to call that a fix, then. I will do a full test and check in the change, which a) consistently uses the same constant for @Path annotation values involving PIDs, b) allows for ":", "%3A", or "%3a" as the namespace delimiter of the PID as it occurs in the path segment, and 3) tests all three of those encodings as part of the configA &amp; B tests via some test reques</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;cwilper&gt; any other things to test/look out for you can think of?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;barmintor&gt; cwilper: Not off the top of my head.  Thanks for hunting this down, sorry the CXF/jaxrs move has been such a pain</span><br />
