<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; pbecker meant to say: I tried to  discuss this in jira (DS-1348) and #dspace (regarding DS-2497) already. But if necessary we should talk about it again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, I'm looking at 1348...there's good discussion there, but then it stops after you created the PR.  Just wondering, pbecker, if your proposed behavior in the PR is actually "accepted", or if people haven't reviewed that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; so what is the best way to get the discussion started now and not one or two weeks before pr freeze?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'd tag mdiggory to see if he has any comments on the design</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: as hpottinger mentions, you could mention names in the ticket (1348) to see if there are any last comments/suggestions on the change in behavior.  mentioning users by name now sends them an email "ping" on that ticket.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: mhwood and hpottinger "accepted" the idea, and mdiggory did not respond anymore. one reason I brought it up today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, you could "@mdiggory" and ask him directly whether he approves of the behavior change in the PR, or has any concerns/comments.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; all right.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; hpottinger, thanks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I think part of the issue is that during the release / development cycle, developers will live on master, but the rest of the year / off-cycle, developers will live on whatever version their site is using. So, if my site is still 4.x, it will be hard to work on 6.x, until I dedicate time to focus on 6.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We could also schedule time in a future meeting and try and get one or more @mire staff in this discussion.  I agree though, I'd rather move this forward sooner than later</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; to be clear, I haven't tagged anyone, I was just saying mdigorry would be the person at @mire I'd tag</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Soon my sites will be on 5.x, which shrinks the gap. Also, if you stood up a specific feature / demo site, that demonstrates here is my UI problem, and here is another instance that has this PR in it. Test this fixed behavior..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; So I'll tag mdigorry and abollini (as he reported DS-1814) and would be glad, if this topic could be discussed in two weeks again.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: if you don't get responses to the ticket...the next step would be to either describe the behavior change in an email (to -devel or -commit) asking for "final feedback" and/or schedule a future meeting to discuss this.  My opinion is that we need this behavior change to have more eyes...once it's fully 'vetted', then the PR itself seems very reasonable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: thanks, that is a roadmap.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks for bringing it up again, pbecker. And thanks for your hard work on this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other topics that folks would like to discuss today?  We're nearing the end of the meeting, but we have a few more minutes here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; peterdietz brought up the Java roadmap the other day.  I've just updated my dev. environment to Java 8.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aha, yes, Java 8. I forgot about that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC Java 7 is EOL at the end of *this month*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Is anyone running DSpace on Java 8 yet?  I admit, I'm still on Java 7, even though, yes it is EOL this month</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm thinking that we ought to develop and test on 8, and leave the compiler input/output versions at 7 for now.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We likely should have a ticket to update our dependencies to Java 8 (and track any issues we may find).  DSpace 6 should obviously now require Java 8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to developing and testing on Java 8 now for "master"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sounds like a job for Vagrant-DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Yeah, Oracle is ending jdk7 support. Its an open thing, so maybe someone else will continue support for openjdk7... ??? But, to be safe, jdk8 is where the language has moved. So, we need to ensure we're compatible / working good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; sorry, have to go.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 vagrant-dspace also being updated to Java 8, hpottinger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; good bye everyone!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bye pbecker</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Not just build errors, but, if we had an automated user / acceptance testing thing (umm... selenium, cucumber), then hopefully that could catch explosions caused by changing jdk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; my opinion is that DSpace 6 should require Java 8 or above (as we shouldn't be encouraging usage of any EOL versions of any prerequisites).  So, that means we need to obviously develop "master" with Java 8 from here on out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: I'd welcome some automated user/acceptance testing..just needs someone(s) to help make that happen (i.e. get it started, and let us know how to chip in)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Do we want to update the compiler plugin's version config right away?  That would ensure awareness, but also throw a brief stumbling block in front of everyone developing on master.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: yes, as long as doing so doesn't completely "break" the compilation of "master"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i.e. we shouldn't break master....but we should move it quickly to using Java 8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So that needs testing and maybe fixing.  Who wants to write the Jira?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd welcome whoever wants to start this process to write the JIRA ticket ;)</span><br />
