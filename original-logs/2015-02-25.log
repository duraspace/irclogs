<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I wish I could say I prepped more for this meeting...but, unfortunately I've just been "fighting fires" in the last 24 hours.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The most recent fire (still burning strongly) is that none of our DSpace mailing lists are currently working.

<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This morning, I've also been investigating a possible "rapid migration" to Google Groups from SourceForge mailing lists....because as far as I'm concerned, this is one of the "last straws" for SourceForge.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 moving</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm sure we've talked this topic to death, but, can you recap why self-hosting mail man is not an option?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Andrew Woods from Fedora has done a similar migration from SF -&gt; GG for Fedora about a year back...he's passed along his notes on the process. It's not exactly *easy*, but if we don't have any other way to communicate, it's now the top priority on my list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: mostly just that DuraSpace doesn't run a mailmain. All other DuraSpace projects use Google Groups for mailing lists.  So, we've never hosted mailman ourselves</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: is the list of "mailing list members" accessible?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, the mailing list subscribers/members *is* accessible.  The *archives* are also accessible (though I'm having difficulty downloading the dspace-tech archives...likely it's just massive in size).  The archives obviously end as of Monday, when the lists stopped working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I've successfully downloaded the archives from all other lists...*except* dspace-tech</span><br />

I just wish we had a way to communicate any of this to our users...but, if I can get the "dspace-general" list migrated quickly enough, we can do that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, and as part of this migration...I'm proposing we rename "dspace-general" (which is a bad name) to something like "dspace-community" (Fedora's community list is called "fedora-community")</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; what's the story with 4.x?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; There were a few (minor, now fixed, I believe) "fires" in the release processes yesterday.  Namely, the 4.x branch was in an "unstable" state</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The 4.x branch now seems to be ready.  I need to rerun the release from there though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Latest status is.... 3.4 is released &amp; available (unannounced though, obviously).  4.3 is "in process", and 5.1 is last in line</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I wrote into #sourceforge, but I don't think that I'll get any help over there now. We should look for their business hours and try again later.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue, hpottinger: thanks for your work on the releases!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, regarding all our releases.  I think the rest of the 4.3 and 5.1 release processes should go smoothly (fingers crossed).  The "Release Notes" for each are still in process (but mostly there).  I haven't drafted an announcement yet (but we need the lists back to do that, obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I will also mention, I've started adding Release information to GitHub (in their "releases" section)... <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/releases">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/releases</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Currently it wrongly says "4.3" is the latest release, only cause that's the last one I did. Once 5.1 is out there, it will be tagged "latest")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think that's really the latest info I have...as mentioned, it's been a crazy last 24 hours.  Hopefully SourceForge will fix our mailing list issues today (but in the meantime, I'm starting the Google Groups migration process behind the scenes, just in case)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: do you want to alert the community to the possible move?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: are the release branches still open for other bugfixes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: no. Releases are happening.  3.4 is out, 4.3 is tagged (but not yet to Maven Central).  5.1 is coming soon.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: not quite yet. As the Google Groups migration takes some time, if SF *responds* we'll stay on SF (for now, at least).  If they don't respond, then I'll let the community know once the Google Groups migration is "almost there"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other questions / thoughts here?  Our agenda is very light today.. I honestly don't have any other topics for today :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; looking forward to 6, do we want to bump all our dependency versions soon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, another SF project just noted their mailing list is also down. This SF problem may get resolved (hopefully).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; regarding DSpace 6. Sure, now is the time to start to think about bumping up dependencies.  Likely we need to do it in a JIRA ticket / PR though, obviously</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; are there any plans to work on our database connection? Perhaps introducing some new orm, going to use hibernate or some other framework?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; While I started using (and developing) DSpace I saw some plans, but I do not know there current status and who was working (or thinking about) on it?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Regarding DB connection....

<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aha. Yea, it's possible Kevin is even working more on this behind the scenes too...not sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; If I'll start thinking about it, I'll contact KevinVdV...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We should remember to also ask KevinVdV to be sure he *is* planning on this for DSpace 6.  Again, I don't have a formal verification...just heard it was of interest to @mire / Kevin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* pbecker loves postgres, but has some local reasons to look for other dbms</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I have an idea, maybe we put some of these "big changes" ideas on the table for the meeting at OR15?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: good point. Probably about time to start up an OR15 Meeting page (on wiki) and adding in some possible topics to discuss</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I have a heads up regarding Solr 5</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; The important news is that Solr 5 will no longer be distributed as a war, but rather as a separate server (customized jetty)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; (actually Solr 5 was released this week)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so this may be time to start planning what we'll do in the DSpace 6 timeframe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; huh, I hadn't noticed that yet, helix84.  Good to know.  At the same time, that seems a tad harder to work with, if you just want to use Tomcat for everything. Hmmm...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the obvious option would be to distribute the Solr server along DSpace, kind of like we do with the local handle server</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I don't like the habit of apps to run containers for their own. Ending up with a lot of servlet containers using a lot of memory which could be used better.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we might also consider if we want to do an ElasticSearch implementation of our Discovery and perhaps switch from Solr to ES sometime (just throwing an idea out there)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; or we might want to stay with Solr 4.10.x for DSpace 6</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; jumping to ES is definitely another option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Or staying on Solr 4 for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; As long as we reign in the auto-wiring for ES... I want to be able to tell it what NIC to bind to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I think I had one more option in mind but I don't remember what it was :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: would you be willing to start up a JIRA ticket to begin this discussion?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Hi all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; Another piece of info regarding Solr 5 is that it will be able to migrate indexes in Solr 4.10 format automatically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; It's a similar situation to out 3.5.0 -&gt; 4.10.2 migration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger waves to robint.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; re. Hibernate, I have a feeling Cineca did a Hibernate implementation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Hmm... it's an early meeting day, where are the? :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; DSpace 6 with Solr 5 would have an ant task to download the solr 4.10.x jar, do an index upgrade</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; *they</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; then Solr 5 would upgrade the 4.10.x index to 5.x format automatically</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; (IOW Solr 5 won't support 3.x indexes anymore)</span><br />
