<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; We're actually encountering more serious issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; PDF's are served from DSpace irregularly, the problem seems to lie with Apache Cocoon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; I can't determine where the problem lies without that log</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ah, the old "layered problems" problem.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; Unfortunately, when the cache is disabled, all is well except for an issue in which protocol.xml cannot be retrieved from the JNDI for the advanced search</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; based on our discussion yesterday, I realized that 675 needed to be flagged in our workflow as "needs volunteer" so I did so.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; Because our problem (in which protocol.xml cannot be retrieved for the "advanced-search" URI is specific to 1.6.2), I'm uncertain as to whether I should bother modifying the source code, and just update to a more recent version</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Now we just need to find someone who knows the guts of Cocoon well enough to dive in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; Any thoughts?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; from the IRC chat log pasted in to 675, it looks like mdiggory had an idea of a possible course of action</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger wishes cocoon were a livelier project...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I run away from cocoon. What is meant by PDF's are served from DSpace "irregularly"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; At first glance, this seems like three separate problems.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; PeterDietz: At times, PDF's fail to download in response to a request over the HTTP</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; PeterDietz: This is resolved when the Apache Cocoon caching is disabled entirely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; what exactly does "fail to download" mean?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; even with DSpace 1.6.2 you can clear an old Cocoon cache</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; hpottinger: I've cleared it on multiple occasions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hmm. You could make responding to bitstreams non-cached. a non-caching pipeline</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I do like cache though. It keeps the site from dying of performance woes, but I'm not sure how often a bitstream is hit while still hot in the cache</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Did clearing the cache *help*?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; mhwood: Clearing the cache did not help</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: When a user downloads a PDF (or, presumably, any bitstream; but we have only ingested PDF's), the servlet seems to time out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; and I guess there isn't anything in the dspace or tomcat logs at the default log level</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; how big are these PDFs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: Apache indicates that the file is sent ("mod_proxy_http.c(1848): proxy: end body send" in the log at LogLevel debug)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yeah good point hpottinger. jrgriffiniii, is there a pattern as to which PDFs are affected? all of them? just those above a certain size?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; The PDF's are generally from ~100kb to ~5mb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; The size does not seem to affect the performance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; so it's some of the PDFs all the time? or is it essentially random whether it works for a given PDF or not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; It's odd, I can only reproduce the error with a series of successive download attempts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; It's essentially random</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; 1/13 or 1/15 attempts on average</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; sounds very strange</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; I've ensured that caching is disabled for httpd with a mod_cache directive</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; So the HTTP proxy isn't likely introducing anything problematic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; have you tried bypassing httpd completely (not that I think httpd is the problem), eg download via wget from localhost:8080 on the box?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: The problem cannot be reproduced with wget alone</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: lynx, wget, curl...all of these retrieve bitstreams properly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Too many variables...wget et al. do not show the problem, when proxying, or when going direct to the servlet container?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; jrgriffiniii: you mean when you use the command-line tools on the box? or even when you use the command-line tools from a different machine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: both</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; mhwood: When proxying, bitstream content is received successfully when using command-line tools only</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; so you just get the problem in GUI browsers? or just in specific ones? from everywhere, or just from specific machines?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: From my CentOS workstation using Firefox and Google Chrome, from Windows 7 workstations using Firefox, and from an iPad 2 using Safari</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I assume all these boxes are in the same network (your instition's), is that correct? does it work fine from outside that network? do these boxes use a proxy to get to DSpace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: I have no ability to directly contact the users, and all issues are directed to me through an administrator (i. e. I never receive any error reports; I'm only told to address certain issues by an administrator)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: These boxes are on the same network, and I've tested this from workstations within various subnets of the institution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; jrgriffiniii: I was wondering whether you'd tried to reproduce the problem eg from your home machine, or got a friend at a different institution to try or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; aschweer: I've also verified that the issue is present from outside of the network entirely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; ah good, that's what I was after I guess :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can't imagine how it would make a difference, but one common difference between commandline and GUI clients would be that the former won't be interested in CSS.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; mhwood: I was running curl and httperf with 100% success rates (2xx responses for all tests)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yup, just brainstorming....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK, dumb question time: what version of Cocoon are we running under the hood here?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jrgriffiniii&gt; I'm uncertain</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, *that's* different.  I wonder if Cocoon is doing its own log4j configuration, and then somehow we come along and confuse it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I suppose block-level debugging would be helpful...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sorry, didn't mean to hijack the whole Developers meeting :-\ but 675 has been on the "to fix" list for a while.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It was pretty quiet anyway, and I agree, this has been something that we need to fix, for too long.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm far from a Cocoon expert, but, I might as well claim this ticket</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It definitely looks like Cocoon is trying to manage log4j itself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, potential problem is collision of what we were asking of log4j and what Cocoon is asking? Or possibly a version miss-match of log4j libraries?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Perhaps.  Cocoon may be doing something to log4j that we don't expect.  Pure speculation....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; well, this looks like it will be good for me :-) a nice "learning experience"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That page you cited:  the configuration there doesn't look like anything that the log4j property configurator would read, or understand.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, we may need to do more to actually direct cocoon to log to its own file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's what I'm thinking.  We may have to figure out how to do it "the Cocoon way".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Whatever that is.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We may have been lucky that our way ever worked.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think we might be able to "fix" this with a documentation change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; At least it may provide a workaround.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ugh, Avalon...another dead project.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; yehaw!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sorry, it's the Missourian in me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I was being ironically excited about the tech under the hood of Cocoon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; One good reason to move to Cocoon 3 (if it ever leaves alpha):  shake off all that old dead Avalon/Excalibur stuff that you can't even find anymore.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, what do you think about maybe just trying Cocoon3 in a branch?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was just thinking that perhaps the way to get Cocoon 3 to release would be to declare that DSpace 4 will use it, start finding broken stuff, and flood them with issues until it firms up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I mean, the cocoon devs clearly are thinking in terms of 3 being *the* release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; even if they haven't pulled the lever on the official release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It won't be a drop-in replacement for 2.2, though.  There's pretty much a new team on C3, they dropped a lot of existing stuff, and it's pretty thoroughly reorganized.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger grumbles</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yeah, the C3 dev.s are standing around waiting for the community to adopt C3, while the community is waiting for C3 to release (or even graduate to beta).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I remember mdiggory proposing another path, something about replacing cocoon with webmvc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; C2.2 -&gt; C3 probably means the same thing that happened with Maven:  forget how we used to do it and embrace the C3 Way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; grahamtriggs wanted to do a webmvc UI, IIRC.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I like webmvc better than the idea of webmvc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Would it help if you saw a demo of webmvc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; i.e. I love wiring up third-ish party modules</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think I should also add the wijiti REST API up too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; TBH I think DSpace already has too many UIs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; disclaimer: I worked on the webmvc project for a bit</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was just diagramming. I would like to make DSpace + REST API be THE way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; then build your "heads" on top of that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; to be fair to mdiggory, my understanding is he was talking about the actual spring webmvc, and not the UI based on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Sorry, but it looks like I've stolen someone elses concept</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; but, sure, it would be interesting to replace Cocoon with REST</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger does not know what that would look like</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; seems like a lot of effort just to keep XML in the workflow, though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; XMLUI is kind of couched in the world of the early 2000s, where XML was *the thing* that everyone was going to use to do everything. I think the idea was that you could farm out customization work to interested power users.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oh.  The idea seems to have been that you could hand a lot of the work to XML types instead of programmers.  As usual, forgetting that you've only created a new class:  XML programmers.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; exactly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Where XML shines is in places where you can hand it to *machines* instead of people.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; XSLT: world's stupidest programming language</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can't help thinking that XSL would make a good deal of sense, once I wrap my head around the processing model.  Which is taking forever.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Worse than learning LISP after FORTRAN.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think the idea was to make it self-documenting… but I don't think that goal was met</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Can't work.  The machine doesn't read the documentation to do its job, so you can put anything there...or nothing.  The only stuff that gets done is what makes the compiler shut up and the processing happen.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And you can easily create an XML schema that looks like utter nonsense when used, but still works just fine.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; anyhow, it's all good fun to bash XSLT, but, honestly, if it hasn't delivered on the promise, and we have to invest a lot of effort to keep an interface based on it going… maybe it's time for change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I would be willing to try changing to C3, which looks like almost as much of a revolution as switching to something entirely separate.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The problem is that the promise of which you speak can't be fulfilled.  "Programming without programmers" just creates new types of programmers, and self-documentation has never worked because documentation only has meaning to people.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think we have other groups working on revolutionary changes, I think Lyncode is working on a different template system, and we have REST-API</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I agree mhwood on your assessment of the situation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; in practical terms, I think just documenting how to turn on debugging for Cocoon is probably the best approach, and we probably need to have a chat about what comes after Cocoon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; As if I didn't have enough going on…I find myself thinking that I, too, should get my feet seriously wet with C3.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes to both, with the modification:  what comes after C2.2.</span><br />
