<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; hello all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; sorry for little bit late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; traffic!!! :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; Hi Zico! I think it is just you and me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; Have you had anyone contact you because of your role as a DSpace Ambassador?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; yea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; actually many universities and instituitions are trying to implement dspace in their organization</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; and... they contacted me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; but.. i don`t think that... it`s for my "Ambassador" role</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; actually.. what i think... they know me from before as our university is the *one* who implemented DSpace *perfectly* in whole Bangladesh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; more because of your current projects/affiliations?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; how do they hear about you? has there been some promotion or presentation at  a conference?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; umm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; actually yea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; when we implemented dspace in our university, we organized a launching ceremony</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; plus... i took a 3 day technical workshop in South-East University of Dhaka on "DSpace: it`s implementatin and prospect"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; that`s how they know me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[0:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; did you do much customization to your repository?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; Sorry Valorie, i had to go for my boss`s call</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; not that much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; Zico, my apologies, but I must sign off. It was nice chatting with you. If you have anything to add -- including your opinion on whether or not we should hold regular mtgs please let me know.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; but... header, footer, news</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; Communities and Collections and others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; I'll be sending out a link to the notes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; yes, i think, the meetings should be more frequent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; but, why the people are absent ??</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; I'm not sure. What is your local time?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; now... it`s 12:05 pm Dhaka, Bangladesh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;Zico&gt; it was 11 am</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; We don't have that many ambassadors from Asia -- but the attendence has been light on the mtgs today. We have close to 30 ambassadors and I think only 8 (including you) attended a mtg.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; We can discuss it on the ambassador google group -- see if there is feedback on mtgs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[1:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ValorieHollister&gt; I need to head to bed -- it is after 1am my time. Good night -- and thanks for joining the mtg!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[14:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, we'll be starting the DSpace Developers Mtg here in just a few minutes.  I sent an agenda across dspace-devel: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4B7C0DA3.7010109%40duraspace.org&amp;forum_name=dspace-devel">https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=4B7C0DA3.7010109%40duraspace.org&amp;forum_name=dspace-devel</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, it looks like most folks have made there way here.  I believe stuartlewis is traveling, so he likely won't be here.  So, we can go ahead and get started with a Testathon update, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Latest update from Testathon --  I haven't heard much from folks testing, but there have been very few bugs entered into Jira this week (and all that I've seen look minor).  I'm hoping to set aside a large part of this meeting to catchup on Jira, and look at these bugs, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'm assuming we still look to be good to release 1.6.0 on March 1 or 2  -- assuming we don't come across anything serious in the remaining testing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (but, speak up if you disagree!)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-green">* PeterDietz (~PeterDiet@ACK5859s3.lib.ohio-state.edu) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That also brings me to another comment.  I'd appreciate it if the committers could take a lead on tackling any small bugs that have come in...  Both Stuart &amp; I will unfortunately be out of town all of next week, so we likely won't be in #dspace, but are available via email</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, I'd like to suggest canceling next weeks Dev meeting, as many of us will be at either dev8D or code4lib.  However, if any of you still want to meet, feel free.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; is anyone opposed to canceling next week?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; because of these upcoming conferences, our release schedule is obviously a bit tight...I'm hoping to do the "Final freeze" on March 1 around 15:00 UTC (I'll send this out via email as well after this meeting).  If any serious issues come up before then, we'll obviously push that back (but hopefully nothing will)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone have comments/questions about the upcoming release schedule, etc.?  or does this sound good (send me a +1 if you are onboard)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;keithg&gt; can you all get jeff updated documentation before release? if so +1 (though I'm not a committer)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; keithg: Yes, I'll touch base with Jeff to be sure he's still fine with March 1....last I talke to him, he said things were looking good on his end, as long as there are no more major problems found during testathon</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;keithg&gt; thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok..the next-to-last topic (before a Jira Review):   I've been mentioning a few times in our Dev meetings to start thinking about how we'd like to improve/change the release process for the next release (1.7) -- if there's anything we'd like to change we can do so.   There are now 3 different proposals posted on the Wiki: <a href="http://wiki.dspace.org/index.php/Proposals#Release_Cycle.2FProcess_Proposals%3Cbr%20/%3E">http://wiki.dspace.org/index.php/Proposals#Release_Cycle.2FProcess_Proposals%3Cbr%20/%3E</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd encourage everyone to read those and add your thoughts/ideas --  I'm working on scheduling a Special Topics meeting to discuss these in more detail.  Right now it's between March 3 and March 10 -- if you have a preference let me know (it sounds like so far, March 10 may be better for most)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* kshepherd jumps in, a little late</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll send out an email on this as well, once I have a date scheduled -- but until then, I'd encourage thoughts/ideas (you don't have to be a committer to put in your thoughts/ideas on any of these proposals, or add your own proposal)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; welcome, kshepherd :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Any other topics / thoughts from anyone before we dig into a Jira Review?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It would be good to hear from folks who are *not* in the code all the time (or ever) about their release concerns.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm +1 on special topics, as I'm in the each release should have "something in it for me" that applies to a broad group, as opposed to just behind the curtains fixes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood:  I agree.   I forgot to mention, this is only step #1 of this discussion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Valorie and I have been talking about splitting this release procedure discussion into ~3 parts:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; #1 - Ask developers for input, thoughts, immediate "wins" from their standpoints</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, sometimes all you have is critical bugfixes, although there is probably enough pent-up feature work to give us a nice selection to schedule into each release for some time.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; #2 - Talk to Repo Managers in community about their concerns or ideas around past release schedules, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; #3 - pull together these ideas into joint "proposals" or "plans" and start to figure out how we want to move forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds good to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, in all these steps, I don't want this to indefinitely delay any immediate work we (the devs) can do to start planning for 1.7  -- so, not all of this may have happened before we begin 1.7 work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: thanks!    Anyone else have comments on this plan?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Well, we should be able to converge on the developing plan.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: exactly.  we'd converge and move towards the developing plan, once it has been developed :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok...if there are no further comments right now, I'd like to suggest we dig into Jira and see what we can review!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; ok. DS-487, DS-486, DS-485, DS-484 are all links to "howto" style doco.. should probably move the links to the wiki and inform Hilton.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: yea, I noticed that.  Do you want to take the lead on cleaning those up?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep sure</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, we last reviewed DS-466.  Here's our running list: <a href="http://jira.dspace.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;&amp;pid=10020&amp;resolution=-1&amp;created%3Aprevious=-6w&amp;status=1&amp;assigneeSelect=&amp;sorter/field=created&amp;sorter/order=ASC">http://jira.dspace.org/jira/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&amp;&amp;pid=10020&amp;resolution=-1&amp;created%3Aprevious=-6w&amp;status=1&amp;assigneeSelect=&amp;sorter/field=created&amp;sorter/order=ASC</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, we'll be starting with DS-467...let me pull that one up here, and we can start the voting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Consider making the JSPUI styles.css.jsp a  static file: <a href="http://jira.dspace.org/jira/browse/DS-467">http://jira.dspace.org/jira/browse/DS-467</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mark D is a +1 too, if you read his comments ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 - seems like a quick win</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (yea, i laughed at his comments...obviously mdiggory is watching a lot of olympics)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Wait, is that 1.6.0 or 1.6.1?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; 1.6.1 i guess.. bit late for 1.6.0 now?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That was my thinking.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd say 1.6.1 as well.... only necessary fixes from here on out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (for the rest of this, we may want to add version #'s after our votes....e.g. +1 for 1.6.1, etc.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, that one passes for 1.6.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; though it is a small change... there's a chance people won't notice and will keep 'styles.css.jsp' in their modules/jspui/... dir, and wonder why their theme doesn't work anymore ;) so this change will need doco and maybe an announcement somewhere?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; <a href="http://jira.dspace.org/jira/browse/DS-468">http://jira.dspace.org/jira/browse/DS-468</a> : CLONE - Foreign characters broken in  group names.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; kshepherd:  note that in JIRA?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: I agree...i'll add a comment for docs to it in Jira</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeh</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; DS-468 looks good to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; but i haven't tested it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; have you verified DS-468?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, if it really is an issue, I'd vote +1 for 1.6.0  (small patch, necessary fix) -- but it'd be good to verify this problem first (to ensure it's not a misconfiguration causing it)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, can I assign to you then, kshepherd.  If confirmed, I'd say this seems like something we can commit immediately</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yep no prob</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: ok, sounds like you verified it then...if the fix works for DS-468, I'd say go ahead and commit it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DS-470, +1, post-1.6.0.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; DS-470: +1 for addressing the issues post-1.6.0.  -1 for applying the patch as it stands</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I think DS-470 will require a bit more work/discussion..i'd agree with grahamtriggs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, we'll leave it at that for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; DS-470 +1 to the general idea, but graham had some reasonable objections to viewing "speeding up batch jobs" as a priority over "reducing system load"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Good point.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Note: DS-471 came across dspace-devel -  The patch is small, but I haven't had a chance to verfy it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i tested this patch, it works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; kshepherd: that's more an issue about calling it 'scalability' when it's only improving performance in one specific case. the real problem is in the (unnecessary) breaking of the encapsulation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; should we let DS-471 into 1.6.0?  Or wait for 1.6.1 -- thoughts?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; that too..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I'll admit, I don't know how many people encounter DS-471 -- so, I don't know if it's a minor or major annoyance)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, I'll stand out on a limb and vote +1 1.6.0 for DS-471</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeah +1, since handle prefixes are rightly  treated as strings everywhere else, pretty much</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; +0, I'd need more context than the patch gives to feel better about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; but i'm thinking most of our 1.6.0 pushes should just be the bugs found during testathon?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: yes..essentially, I'd like to limit 1.6.0 pushes to just necessary bug fixes...  (whether they are found specifically in testathon doesn't matter to much to me)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, the question is, is this a *necessary* bug fix...for now, it sounds like we are wavering, so we probably should wait for 1.6.1 afterall</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i think waiting would be fine</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree.  Tomcat expects to own the stuff it touches and it's very difficult to get around that.  Maybe the submitter could handle this with Posix ACLs?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone want to follow up with him, give a few suggestions, and close this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yes, ACLs offer much more than the simple user/group modes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can follow up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; however, just changing tomcat's umask in /etc/bashrc or whatever will do it</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; is it just missing from dspace.cfg, and docs then?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, more discussion.  We keep seeing things like this, all over the place.  There's a need to step back and look at them in context.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeah</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, 478 seems as though it might be a little too specific to the way a particular site does monitoring.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; monitoring software should *never* be part of what it's trying to monitor ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh! it's just adding an "if (bundles.length &gt;0)"...that's much clearer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it checks to see if there are any bitstreams left in the bundle before applying setPrimaryBitstream to bundle[0]</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yeah, the whole authn system needs discussion</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i don't think i've ever encountered this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; No patch, needs investigation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, it needs verification...anyone to volunteer?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; also, it doesn't say if this is XMLUI or JSPUI...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; needs followup as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; or even which dspace version ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-481:  Tim will followup.  We need more details, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; skipping DS-482 - it's Serbian Translation...can be released later (translations are separate)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; <a href="http://jira.dspace.org/jira/browse/DS-483">http://jira.dspace.org/jira/browse/DS-483</a> : statistics.item.authorization.admin  ignored by xmlui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (also claudia is already working on DS-482...fyi)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; so, this seems to be either a typo in the xmlui stats when it does the getProperty for statistics.item.authorization.admin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; OR.. ben has assumed the opposite of what i assumed when we looked at 'statistics.item.authorization.admin'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; my understanding was that this meant "admin-only access for stats"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, that'd be my assumption as well.... "true" means admin-only</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; which is why JSPUI blocks non-admins from viewing if statistics.item.authorization.admin=true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; but this is still quite an ambiguous parameter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; statistics.public = false would be better, imho</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, the parameter is badly named in general...it has nothing to do with "item" for one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Community discussion on what this ought to mean, or what it is that people want to configure?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; mhwood: what people feel is more intuitive when they're editing dspace.cfg for the first time, i guess..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think we know what it currently means.  It enables/disables whether stats are public vs. admin-only.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; here's the XMLUi code that ignores it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; <a href="http://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/dspace/trunk/dspace-xmlui/dspace-xmlui-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/xmlui/aspect/statistics/StatisticsAuthorizedMatcher.java">http://scm.dspace.org/svn/repo/dspace/trunk/dspace-xmlui/dspace-xmlui-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/app/xmlui/aspect/statistics/StatisticsAuthorizedMatcher.java</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; what peopole want to configure is another question (cause it could be a lot of things), and it's post 1.6.0 :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; ok, sure, lets not worry about the wording</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd: Can you work to sync that code up with JSPUI code, since you  know this well?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; it's kidna confusing, actually</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; quite different to my jspui implementation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, ok.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i know the backend stats api code, and the jspui, but not the xmlui stuff :/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; can i paste big here? ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll send an email to ben bosman and mdiggory about this then...see if one of them will fix it to work the same as JSPUI for now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; ok</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks resolved to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; is it resolve though?  this seems odd that we'd give different links based on which system is being used?  or am I misunderstanding?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; does JSPUI actually have different bitstream links?  oh..maybe it does (testing now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh..it does..my bad :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC it has to work that way because the two UIs have different ways of building URLs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I do see an open question, though:  how to configure it for the right style.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and I don't know the answer to that question? do any of you?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; nope</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looks like an implicit feature request.  Needs develpment</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, so this isn't really a bug...just a UI oddity, in that there's a "Jump to menu" even if everything is being displayed on one page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; DS-492:  Needs  more discussion.  UI harmonization perhaps, but we need a patch, etc.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd agree.  DS-493 needs more investigation.  Not ready for 1.6.0 as we don't know why or how to fix</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; At first glance it sounds like a browser quirk.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, in any case, seems relatively minor, and may not need an immediate fix</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood:  so, this is not meant for 1.6.0, right.  Just something to resolve for 1.6.1?  Or is it causing big issues?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm nervous about changing something so deep in the core of what DSpace does.  No, I would recommend against putting it in 1.6.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  This sounds like a good fix to me, but I'd also vote post-1.6.0.  Needs more eyes on it, more testing from both Oracle &amp; PostgreSQL folks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I don't know of another case where this causes problems, but it looks incorrect as is.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[16:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Will do.</span><br />
