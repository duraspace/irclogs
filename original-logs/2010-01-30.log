<span class="irc-date">[2:25]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Good morning all! As you are aware we're about to start the migration over to ircd-seven shortly, I am about to take a snapshot of the services database and copy across topics and channelmodes (bans, invexes etc). This means that any changes you make to channel modes or services after this point (on hyperion) will be lost. We'll be a bit noisy as the migration goes on and will global to keep you updated. Thanks for your patien</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[2:57]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Server Notice] Hi, for users on leguin we would encourage you to make sure that your client is set to reconnect to main rotation (chat.freenode.net) as this server will not be immediately available after migration. Thank you!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:00]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, services and channel states have now been migrated over to the new production network. We're migrating utility bots/pseudoservers as we speak and we're nearly ready for users. Users connected to calvino, crichton, kubrick, leguin and verne may wish to make sure they are re-connecting to chat.freenode.net as these servers will not be immediately linked on newnet as they are pending upgrades first. Thank you!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[3:29]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-christel- [Global Notice] Hi all, The migration is complete! newnet is up and running and you may now manually connect to irc.freenode.net, ports stay the same, however SSL listens on ports 7000 and 7070 if you wish to connect via SSL. We'll be taking down hyperion servers momentarily and we shall see you on the other side! Thank you!</span><br />

Channel operators can use /mode ##channel -q $~a to let unidentified people talk again. Feel free to jump into #freenode if you should have any questions about this. Thank you for using freenode.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[18:34]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- Hi folks! A few moments ago that we suffered a rather large split. This was because a minor core code update to fix default channel mode settings did not go smoothly on a subset of servers, causing them to restart. We've made procedure changes so as not to let it happen again and we deeply apologise and thank you for using freenode! If you have any problems, as ever, #freenode is open to help.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[19:54]</span> <span class="irc-brown">-Martinp23- Hi everyone. We've disabled the +S chanmode for the time being. Normally, +S blocks users from joining a channel if they aren't connecting with SSL. If you still see +S in your channel's modelist, it will have *no effect*. For the now, you will be unable to add or remove this mode. We'll have a more permanent resolution asap. We're sorry for the inconvenience caused by our earlier technical difficulties. </span><br />
