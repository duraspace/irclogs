<span class="irc-date">[16:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; terry-b: currently, JIRA only lets us assign *committers* (unfortunately).  We'd have to do a more significant overhaul of how we manage users in JIRA to fix that... it's possible, but not something I've had time to discuss with Committers</span><br />
