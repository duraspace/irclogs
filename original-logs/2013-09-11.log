<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; It can be turned off, it is enabled by default. The sherpa/romeo data are loaded via ajax so no performance issues for the submission if there are any network problems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; big plus that this is a service, so could be used from XMLUI, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (seems slightly odd to have this integration be part of the *upload* step, rather than part of the metadata capture step, or possibly the "review" step...but again, maybe if I saw a screenshot it'd make more sense)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it make sense in the upload step because sherpa/romeo tell about permission for fulltext</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I can add a screen tomorrow, I already use the last API from sherpa but I want to check that also the schema is ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: oh, I see.  So, it can warn folks that they shouldn't upload the publishers PDF, if they aren't allowed to (for example)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, that makes sense</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree with helix84 - glad this is a service, and I hope that'll make it easier to "port" over to XMLUI as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: exactly and I plan to extend it to the advanced embargo as soon as I complete the review of the zuki PR</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in that case, I'm +1 this feature. I like it (and I hope we can find someone to also port it to the XMLUI at some point)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I might be up for the port to XMLUI, we have folks here interested in this feature</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; i think it's a great idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the fast root to port to the xmlui is to use the same servlet to produce the sherpa/romeo data and include them via ajax in the upload screen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I wouldn't say I did a thorough review, but a quick look over the files looks good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: that would require JSPUI to be deployed, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ideally, that servlet would be a  part of REST API if we had one</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: you can copy the servlet in the xmlui web.xml (not the best solution but it works)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; my only question with 1633 is around RichardRodgers similar "MetadataWebService" curation task.  It also claims to support Sherpa/Romeo integration: DS-1647  (But admittedly, I like the move towards AJAX that bollini has been doing)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; that servlet actually produce an html that is "embedded" via ajax in the upload screen</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (just wanted to note we have two different integrations with Sherpa/Romeo in two different PRs)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: it is a different integration. You can get the publisher name from sherpa if you know the ISSN</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: ok.   I'm not against having two separate Sherpa/Romeo calls (for different purposes). Just would be nice to not duplicate too much in different places (obviously)...and it looks like (at a glance) there isn't much duplication between 1633 and 1647</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Would have to duplicate the servlet code as well, or invent a new place for common servlets to live.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; (Between JSPUI and XMLUI, I mean.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'm not thrilled at the idea of injecting HTML into an XMLUI page; but I've done one RoMEO integration and I understand the need for the servlet to bypass cross-domain policy. I'd accept this as it is for 4.0 and keep in mind to rewrite it in a suitable manner for the REST API later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh common business logic layer, where are you?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it sounds like we are in agreement that 1633 is a "good idea".  Just some questions about the best way to "share" code between JSPUI &amp; XMLUI.  But, at the very least, it sounds like the JSPUI version should probably get into 4.0 (and we should look into how to then port it to XMLUI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; ok, I will try to make the final check tomorrow and get this in early so to help others to port to xmlui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sharing code with XMLUI is something on which we need not wait, since there is as yet nothing in XMLUI to use the shared code.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood++ yea, we can go forward with JSPUI first...then figure out how to share over to XMLUI later</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: should we make this change as part of the XMLUI port or should we start immediately with the new name?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: regarding the configuration name...it seems like it'd might be worth going with a more "generic" name, just so we don't have to switch the config later on.   For example, if the config is "jspui." in 4.0, but changes to "webui." in 5.0, then folks need to go migrate their configurations over</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: please, change it to webui now</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so moving on, the main topic for today is 4.0.  I just wanted to leave us some time here to discuss the 4.0 status, or bring up anything that needs immediate "eyes" for 4.0</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; but this will require some work on my side after that 289 is in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, seems like we get #289 (Solr4) in ASAP, then rebase/re-test 287 &amp; 274 on the new Solr 4.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; snail: well, I imagined you'll put the actual SQL snippets on the wiki page. It's much easier to look at them there than in Jira comments.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; helix84: fair enough</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; if you agree I will try to go ahead fast, put in all the SOLR staff as soon as no break are revealed so to give time to test well all togheter</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; snail: other than that, I don't think we will "do" anything with them at this time - rather it's nice to finally have a place where useful SQL reporting commands can be put and found in one place</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; this PR will conflict with many other PR (advanced embargo, sherpa/romeo, private item meaning review - not yet send) so it will be helpful for me to know if I can rebase and merge it as soon as I have completed the review of the advanced embargo porting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; personally, I think it's a very beneficial feature and nice implementation, as we already discussed it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PR #292 / DS-1639 seems like a good idea to me too. My only comment (added to the JIRA ticket) was to rename your configuration setting.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; also, it may need to be disabled by default since you said it doesn't work in IE &lt; 10 (unless it "fails" cleanly and the upload still works in IE 8 or 9)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; tdonohue: no, it works. It is the jquery plugin that don't work with IE &lt; 10</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, I misunderstood. Nevermind then</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: it's not a show-stopper if you won't do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; off topic: what do you think should be the browser compliance out-of-box for dspace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I don't know - what's in the latest service pack of Windows 7?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I have noted that jquery has started to unsupport &lt; IE9</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; As Tim said, it also matters whether it fails gracefully</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it is no so easy... twitter don't support &lt; IE8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; "Failing gracefully" is most important.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; it redirect to the mobile site and ask to upgrade</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'd prefer not to be too conservative - by the time people will start adopting DSpace 4 en masse, the browser landscape will have moved significantly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd say we could look at major sites like twitter as a good reference...chances are, if you cannot use twitter from your browser, than you cannot be expected to use DSpace ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; just to be clear this is not related to any PR that is already in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm facing this problem with the new theme for jspui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That being said, for IE we probably need to go back to Windows XP (sorry, some libraries are still back there, esp. public libraries).  The latest version of IE that even *runs* on Windows XP is IE 8.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: the difference between dspace and twitter is that twitter is a web service, so it has to work now. DSpace will be used for years, so we can shed legacy support a bit more aggresively.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; actually it works pretty well in IE8 with some workaround but I'm not able to get it works fine with IE7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; About a year ago a website I made a few years back was reported slightly broken on IE7. I had to ignore it because I couldn't find any computer with IE7 anymore :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think supporting IE8 and above is fine...we probably don't need to go all the way back to IE7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; wait, Microsoft makes an image for testing IE compatiblity</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;snail&gt; this aggressive approach only works for things like submission and search, direct access to items found via google scholar and etc should work from a much broader range of browsers</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: no, these are separate VMs. The pack was an installer of the actual programs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; for IE7, IE8 you can also use an IE9 browser change the compatibility settings... or I'm wrong?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, there are now "browser compatibility settings" in more modern versions of IE</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: you can use the legacy rendering mode, but in my experience that doesn't mean it will work in the older version 100%</span><br />
