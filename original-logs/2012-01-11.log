<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Good ideas, I think; just needs an implementation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; This seems more like a problem statement</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to what mhwood said. I like the ideas, we just need someone to "run with this" and bring forward an implementation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; tdonohue +1 -- it'd be neat to have something better than what we have now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; kompewter is dead, my computer is dead (terrible ethernet stability). My new computer comes next week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if anyone is interested in this area, please feel free to claim Ds-919 (no specific timeframe or deadline expected)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I think we need to use something more updated than iplists.com</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Small digression -- if you felt it useful, PeterDietz-alt, you could ping me about bringing kompewter back to life on DuraSpace servers.   It's up to you)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 PeterDietz-alt to that idea as well.  Would be better to move bot detection away from IP-based (as those IPs are never truly "stable", except for the largest bots like Google)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; cool idea.  patch likely needs a close look though (and testing)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* PeterDietz-alt wonders if HTML5 spec has thought about this type of thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone interested in looking at this patch closer (and investigating the HTML5 question -- I'm also not sure)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I'll volunteer to get expand/collapse UI in there for collection list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmmm...one not-so-good thing about this Ds-920 work.  I notice it uses the 'treeview' jQuery plugin which claims to now be unmaintained: <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/">http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-treeview/</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It sounds like three issues to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not very clear whether this build script uses Maven or not.  but, then again, I notice the build script itself wasn't posted for us to review</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; haha :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I'd like to have some significant improvements underway. But in the mean time.. I'm trying to sneak things in before the ReleaseTeam can notice</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; its day time here... It would prefer to be sleeping</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz-alt -- I agree that I'd rather try to move on to 3.0 things.  But, obviously if some major bug pops up, then I'm not against doing a 1.8.2 to stabilize</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; thus.. I'm not aware of anything wrong with 1.8.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; No complaints about 1.8.1, but...I thought the answer to "are we doing 1.8.2 or 3.0 now" was "yes."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I also think this should be a 'free period' before we have to worry about releases for a while - we should encourage experimentation, discussions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, currently we are still under the assumption that there *may be* a 1.8.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 richardrodgers  -- now is definitely the time for major brainstorming / "crazy" ideas / experimentation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; hmm. locally, I'm trying to come up with an alternative to Solr, since we've essentially hit the wall with performance. We're a bit hesitant to buy a VM just for solr, so I've been looking at alternatives (elastic search) that _may_ have better performance than solr. I think KevinVdV  has been looking at another commercial search provider.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Do you know where the problem lies with Solr ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I've recently started a 'modernizer' track of thinking  - taking a small subset of DSpace code and replacing things with newer stuff...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Is it just the quantity of data ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; several several gigabyte large files that need to be written, and read from disk to accomplish operations</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So then IIRC there would be some work to do in further decoupling DSpace from ${particularSearchImplementation}?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Thats a pity. Solr promises so much :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; yep.. xmlui is a bit tied to solr, but thats understandable. I don't know how to abstractly query things.. without doing it the proper way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; RE: Solr, I also wonder whether the fault is Solr itself, or if we do not have a fully "optimized" way of indexing via Solr (i.e. is it how we are using Solr?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; from 'tired' -&gt; 'wired' (as the magazine used to do)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; basically, I think solr doesn't shard as well as I'd like it to (I'm not a lucene-mailing-list expert, so please don't throw stones at me).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; e.g. log4j -&gt; slf4j/logback</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've been using slf4j in new classes, since I noticed we already depend on it.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz-alt -- so, are you convinced that Solr is the problem?

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; richardrodgers, I like that too.. I'll be thinking, there's got to be a really easy way for me to output this date object as ISO8601, so i google it, and the answer is use joda... or do SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-mm-...")</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Um, commons-jdbc is commons-dbcp?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; Wait.. are we voting for richardrodgers to put his stuff on github, or... to cut the rope and make all dspace contributions through github</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; bc.. this could be as simple as people watching Richards fork of the project on github</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; Will do - but for ease of use, I started with a very small subset of DSpace (I'm calling it the 'kernel') - basically a stripped down dspace-api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'm generally in favour of migrating to Github, but what would be the conseqences for Maven releases ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- I'm generally in favor of moving towards github.  But, I'm still very much a novice, and I'm not sure of the best "policies" about contributions via github yet (e.g. Fedora established their own best practices for GitHub: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/Git+Guidelines+and+Best+Practices)">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/Git+Guidelines+and+Best+Practices)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; consequences</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; We'll cross the maven bridge when we get there.. And the good news is that the RT will be a series of people figuring it out, instead of just one person.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to what robint said too. But, I'm sure we can do Maven via GitHub, as Fedora already does it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; robint: I don't think we'd have maven problems; github seem to be interested in making it easy to use the two together: <a href="https://github.com/github/maven-plugins">https://github.com/github/maven-plugins</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; For using Git, there's SmartGit for windows, perhaps even tortoise git. Mac users have tower. And linux users are hardcore, and will use command line.. or git gui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I am sure we can do it, but our current poms and release procedure do depend on the classic SVN directory structure, so there would be work to be donee</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I've been using github for my dspace code since we upgraded to 1.7 and I'm really happy with it. Just annoyed I can't have a public and a private fork of the same project in the same user account</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; robint: ah good point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think my only outstanding concerns with GitHub revolve around what the "preferred workflow" for submissions should be.  I noted that Fedora has specifically noted some things that one should NEVER do via git (as it messes others up): <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/Git+Guidelines+and+Best+Practices">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/Git+Guidelines+and+Best+Practices</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, then again, as Fedora has gone down this path first, we could likely just take the same path they are on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint -- yea, there will likely be a small pain to clean up all the pom references.  But, we could always make sure to run a test release or two after the migration would happen to ensure we have it all working right again (i.e. we wouldn't want to wait until 3.0 release is pending obviously)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I think their flow is fine. The only tricky points I can think of is do we want 2 dozen committers with push access to the repo. Or so have 2 dozen committers, each with a fork, the gets pull requested, and then reviewed by the top-most-reviewer... i.e. Linus</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I'm sure Linus has written a research paper or two. Its gotta be in someone's repo. Maybe we can check some schools in Finland for it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I'm about to run off into another meeting, but would it work to have push access for all committers *but* an agreement that all contributions are done via pull requests?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I agree though, the big issue here is how we all work together via GitHub.  It may initially be a bit of a major change / pain-point early on as we start to figure out what works or what doesn't.  But, in the long run, Github seems like it will help, even if there's initial pain</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; robint: not on the edge of the release, but with enough time to plan out release mechanics, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Why just before rather than, say, just after?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I should note that I did have a intro-to-git session on 2011-02-09, almost a year ago.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; tdonohue: OK, I see - I'm cool moving to GitHub</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree with "getting our feet wet" though (and perhaps moving more of our current DSpace projects/work over to GitHub little by little -- for example, if anyone is working on a new "module" or updating an existing one, why not try and move your work to GitHub to get more familiar in that space)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Would it be worth scheduling a date for a vote to encourage (force) us to give it some thought ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 robint.  Maybe we say we'll vote sometime in Feb (mid or end)?  Gives us a month to ponder things, and also ensures that if we decide to move, we are doing it very *early* in the 3.0 development cycle (so that 3.0 isn't affected)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Sounds like a good timetable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;richardrodgers&gt; I've got to run - but I will put up the 'modernizer' stuff in the next few weeks....</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'm curious to know how tags, branches, trunk etc work in Git land</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks, PeterDietz-alt.  I may take you up on some of that myself in coming days/weeks (as I'm still learning &amp; getting my feet wet) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; tag is just a named commit. Nothing gets copied into a directory called tags. Just there is a pointer with a name to a commit at a specific point in time.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; but our existing tags have migrated to github, and on release day, the RC will just pick the pencils down commit, and tag it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: I'd encourage reading some of the Git resources that Fedora folks have compiled from around the web: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/Git+Resources">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/FCREPO/Git+Resources</a>  (that's how I've slowly been learning about the differences between Git &amp; SVN)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; To think about branches., I'll have to think backwards. i.e. all development gets levied against master (read: trunk)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; then when its time to sunset one line of development and then to shift to another line. i.e. we've just released 1.8.0, then we create a branch, which gets commits pushed to it as needed for the bug fixes. But all other activity would stick to master.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; When doing the Maven release Maven nicely creates an SVN tag and branch for you. I wonder if it does equivelant actions for Git. You would hope so.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; Even if maven didn't create those things for you, (i.e. it just touched your master, and altered the poms.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; In git its an easy, and sometimes common task to jump back in time, and branch off of a previous commit. So, the RC would after the fact, create the tag and the branch. Just a few minutes of work.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz-alt&gt; I'll admit that since I jumped the gun on git, i.e. making OSU's DSpace repository use git before duraspace/dspace used git.
