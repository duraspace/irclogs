<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I would say to use DC schema as default untouched. Then have local people use local fields for custom. To also have a DSPACE schema, for any system generated/expected metadata things</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; "touching" the schema: adding/removing/modifying the scope of Elements, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; e.g. adding a qualifier doesn't necessarily touch/break the schema</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; (just pasting this because it was mentioned on the call)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; i'm not understanding the business value / the "why", of why this change to metadata is worth it. i.e what is it your not able to express currently.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'm not understanding the dc.subject.lcsh part</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; PeterDietz: one thing that we don't have but DCTERMS have is schema. think of it as data type - restrict range, enumerate the vocabulary for a field</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but yea, i didn't understand the subject part, either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so flat compared to nested xml was mentioned.. I'm guessing this allows for relationships between metadata. or do they just want more default fields...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; so i see dc/terms/isFormatOf that would be good on a bitstream. To say scan1.tiff.png isFormatOf scan1.tiff bitstream</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; but that demands relationships between objects</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Main goal of these recommendations</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; The ultimate goal of these recommendations is to implement fully functional DCTERMS as the default metadata schema, thus ensuring compliance with current standards endorsed by DCMI and linked data capabilities, and enabling a metadata infrastructure that supports other hierarchical and relational data structures.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; These recommendations also provide for intermediate steps towards this ultimate goal.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; By bringing the existing default 'dc' schema into compliance with the Qualified Dublin Core standard, we provide an intermediate migration step, enabling repositories to meet compliance with QDC upon upgrade, which will ease the transition to DCTERMS. (See "Possible Phases of Update," below, for further details about staging.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; By locking down schemas (at least at the element level), we ensure compliance with QDC and DCTERMS standards but provide tools to allow customizations not compliant with QDC/DCTERMS to persist in local schema.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; i was just in an agile training session. So i need user stories, with acceptance criteria for this to be implemented</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (mwood@mhw.ulib.iupui.edu) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; Trying to think about a concrete user story</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; Some institutions here are confronted with more strict compliance requirements when it comes to offering up their content for harvesting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; for example the OpenAIRE guidelines or RIOXX in the UK</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; <a href="http://www.rioxx.net/v0-9/">http://www.rioxx.net/v0-9/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; the problem is not that DSpace puts things really horribly wrong, or that some default crosswalks somehow prevent compliance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; however, the admin UI makes it so easy to mess with the DC Schema</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; that some repository managers might have made some wrong decisions in the past, that now put the institution is a really hard, non compliant position when it comes to harvesting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; So the key to the proposal (for new instances) is to prevent this with the lockdown</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; of the standard schemas</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and going further, if they are really getting to DCTerms with the ranges &amp; domains, we could imply more strict validation requirements on what's actually inside the fields</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; but one of the challenges I see is that if one institution really has a big problem with metadata consistency or a "mess from the past"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; like, if it's REALLY a problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; they will have addressed it in another way, and they won't be sitting around for these future DSpace innovations in order to solve this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; So they might have gone in already and done some of the cleanup themselves with lots of manual labor and tears</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I just want to say that the new OAI interface makes it rather easy to deal with "mess" in metadata by allowing one to create a different "view" of the schema visible via OAI-PMH. That is not to say that I'd recommend that approach over cleaning up the schema itself.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; I tend to agree:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; Ingest - internal representation - Export are three different ballparks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; actually, if you have good support for a wide range of ingest formats, and a wide range of export formats</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and the metadata is consistent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; than it suddenly becomes much less of a deal what the internal representation is</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well put</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; I also think some of the metadata schema field descriptions need a real brush up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; for example:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; dc.source	Do not use; only for harvested metadata.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we can do that right away</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and all of the different dc.date variants we have in there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; created, accessioned, available etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; I always need to look this up to know which of them comes with which implication in the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; or this one: 68	dc.description.version	The Peer Reviewed status of an item</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; the metadata schema doesn't tell you that this is required/added because of the SWORD functionality</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; Bram, regarding the descriptions, I would encourage you to go ahead and change them as soon as you can determine what they currently mean</span><br />
