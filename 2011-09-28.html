<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, it's time for our weekly DSpace Dev Mtg again.  Today's agenda is all about 1.8.0 updates / known issues, etc. <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2011-09-28">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2011-09-28</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; First a brief announcement...I'll be out-of-office next week, so Robin will be convening our meeting on Weds, Oct 5</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Beyond that, I was thinking we'd discuss any specific issues that need discussing, and then also do a quick review of 'unassigned' issues (see agenda) to see if we can get any volunteers or ideas for fixes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone have any specific 1.8 related issues to bring up at this time?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Nothing in particular</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'd be happy to go through the issues again as we did last week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; there's been talk about an RC2...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I do have something but I would like to wait until I can get Mark Diggory in here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; hpottinger: Yes we will do an RC2 once most/all the issues are resolved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Hopefully middle-late next week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good on RC2 schedule</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK, I'm happy to load that up in our demo instance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; hpottinger: thanks, I'll keep you informed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, should we begin with a review of some of the "unassigned" issues that are still open &amp; scheduled for 1.8.0 (just to try &amp; find volunteers/ideas)?   We can circle back around to other issues after that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, first up, this is unassigned &amp; discovered by a user during Testathon: DS-1022</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1022">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1022</a> ] - [#DS-1022] Cannot select an option from Authority Control in Chrome or FF - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; It seems to be a javascript error, affecting at least Mirage (haven't tested in other themes)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mdiggory (~mdiggory@rrcs-74-87-47-114.west.biz.rr.com) has joined #duraspace</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anyone familiar enough with Authority Control stuff to look into Ds-1022 in more detail?  Currently Authority Control is completely broken in XMLUI (at least with Mirage)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Silly question but does it work in 1.7 ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes we use it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; no idea. I basically just confirmed this was a bug on demo.dspace.org site (someone had reported it to me). I haven't had time to do any further testing or investigation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; ok thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Mirage is a rewrite of the javascript portions of AC becuase... well.... they sucked</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'll look into it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Is it possible that it is just a config issue on the demo server ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, assign Ds-1022 to robint.  Sounds like @mire folks also have some past experience &amp; may be a good resource</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it could be a config issue -- I suspect it is either that, or a minor bug/typo in javascript (the choice-support.js file which throws the error -- see comments in Ds-1022)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Ok thanks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, next unassigned issue, also reported by a user during Testathon: DS-1025</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1025">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1025</a> ] - [#DS-1025] Mouseover any title in XMLUI displays COINS info (see Advanced Search or Browse by Title - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; there was some discussion of this issue in the comments, but no one has claimed it or written a fix.  Essentially, we probably shouldn't be displaying COINS info on mouseover</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Hmm, I thought that's the way COINS works</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Apparently theres some confusion on that its supposed to do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; COINS just requires a &lt;span&gt; tag.  But, it doesn't need to be wrapped around the title info (like it currently is)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; yes, I think it is fine to move it out of the title.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think the XMLUI should work like the JSPUI currently does (where COINS is just in a &lt;span&gt; that has a non-breaking space)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Famous last words but it sounds like a fairly simple fix</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it should be simple.  It's already doing the "right thing" in JSPUI.  We just need to replicate that concept in XMLUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; has to happen in three places I think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; dri2xhtml, dri2xhtml-alt,  themes/mirage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-green">* keithgilbertson (~keithgilb@207.138.47.158) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, the hardest part here may be tracking down all the places that generate COINs for XMLUI.  But, I think mdiggory has listed all or most of them.  Any volunteers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger reopens the internal ticket from long ago and links it to Ds-1025</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'll take a look at it, this has always bugged me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I've just cut and pasted this conversation into the issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks hpottinger.  Feel free to claim DS-1025.  If you run into issues, let us know.  Hopefully it will be a relatively easy fix though :)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, next unassigned issue: DS-1034 (again reported during Testathon)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was just looking at this, but haven't tracked down the sources of the trail elements yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz are you already looking at this?  Or were you just investigating what other sites do?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; sorry, late as always, but i'm sure that Yin YIn (a dev i work with) and Bill from MIT had been looking at the CoINS template problems</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i will chase it up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; kshepherd -- get in touch with hpottinger there too, he's claimed the issue.  I'm sure between you all someone will figure it out :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; as for Ds-1034 -- mhwood, looking into XMLUI theme code, the Trail is generated by "dri:trail" template, I believe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure what has to change in that template though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; haven't claimed it yet, it's all yours if you want it, kshepherd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, but it's being told that the terminal trail element has a target.  That's being generated in Java code somewhere, I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hpottinger: heh, go for gold! this was possibly an older or unrelated bug i'm thinking of</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm looking at the code now, theres about 6 spots to just move the span and call to rendercoins down a few lines</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hpottinger: but there might be some older discussions/patches that will help you, so i'll ask around</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well, mdiggory, if you've found the resolution to Ds-1025, feel free.  :)  Or pass it off to hpottinger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; the prolbem was that where we want to display/call the coins templates, we didn't have access to the DIM</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; or something</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger is willing to pull the levers, and will happily apply patches all day</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any thoughts on DS-1034, or volunteers to investigate?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1034">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1034</a> ] - [#DS-1034] Incorrectly active breakcrumb links (XMLUI) - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I may as well keep going on Ds-1034</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Much appreciated mhwood</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- one other idea on Ds-1034 -- maybe just tweak the template to not display the 'target' link for  the last element in the trail?  You may be able to fix this with some fancy XSLT :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (just a thought)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 'twould be simpler, but I think it may be against the WING spec.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, mhwood will claim Ds-1034 and investigate it further</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I admit, I haven't looked at the WING spec recently, so you may be correct!)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, it looks like that's the last "unassigned" issue which is scheduled for 1.8.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'll keep that in mind.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Thanks to all volunteers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Does anyone have any specific issues they'd now like reviewed?  Or should we just go through the full list &amp; get quick/brief updates on all?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Lets start with DS-599 first...we'll get to your's next, kshepherd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-599">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-599</a> ] - [#DS-599] SOLR statistics file download displays all files and not only those in the Bundle Original - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; So with the help of Peter Dietz I was able to create a solution for "new" bitstream hits but I'm not sure on how to proceed with updating all those old bitstream hits</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Doing it the "easy" way by looping over all the documents &amp; adding the bundle is just waaaaaaay to slow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; how "slow" is waaaay slow (just curious).  Are we talking hours? days?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; My recommendation in the jira ticket was to explore gerenating a csv file with all the update within them and running a batch update against solr, is that as slow?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How fast does it have to be?  The data are incorrect now, and they get steadily better until the task completes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well it all depends on how many hits you have but my personal findings when talking about a couple milion hits we are talking about a week ...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yuck. ok, that is slow :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; updates against  a large solr index are generally going to degrade query performance as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Going off at a slight tangent, but correcting stats data can be contentious</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I will need to look into the csv update but are you sure you can add conditions to the csv updating ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; robint: you had to go there...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint, even if "correcting" is just adding in a Bundle name to existing stats?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; mdoggory: :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: thats a good point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; KevinVdV: think of the csv file row as an intermediary form of the solr Document your submitting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: although are we not talking about actually correcting the numbers to ignore non 'original' bundles ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the objective would be to (1) dump the solr index to csv (2)adjust teh csv file to include bundles (3) rebuild a new solr core off the csv file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; it would be done offline and it wouldn't be an "update", it would be completely rebuilding a new core</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, in the end, that actually is what happens, robint.   But the only real "correction" in Solr is that we want to add a "bundle" field.  However, the Solr Queries that build that stats pages would then use that field to filter on (if I understand this all completely -- someone correct me if I'm wrong)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; KevinVdV, the question has more to do with where the cost is, are you guys commiting after every SolrDocument update, or are you batching the updates, then commiting after a block of them are completed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: Just reread it and get it now, bit slow on the uptake</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: you got it right...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- that CSV approach is interesting to me (as long as we test it &amp; prove it is "stable", i.e. no data will be lost).  It seems like it could be useful for any sort of future "updates" to the stats data.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; At the moment the auto commit is used markd</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I am willing to check out the CSV update in the weekend</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; right, it could even be "streamed"  dumping from the core, processing in-memory and streaming to the new core.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I assume autocommit defaults to every update...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; thats going to slow things down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Not sure I THINK that the autocommit happens every x number of minutes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Think it is 15 (not sure though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; if its the default SolrLogger that your using, then I think your right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, it sounds like the CSV approach is worth investigating, and perhaps looking at autocommit settings (and whether a tweak there could help performance or not)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; So FYI I will attempt to look into the CSV stuff during my weekend &amp; will report my fidings on monday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; findings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Sounds great, KevinVdV.  Thanks again for your hard work on this!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; It would be nice if whaatever we settled on didn't have to be run as part of a 1.8 upgrade</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; but could be done at leisure afterwards</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; its not so much a csv approach though, IMO, its not trying to update the current statistics core, and instead building a new one to replace the current statistics core.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; ...in an ideal world :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, I'd agree robint.  It'd be nice it have a script to "upgrade-my-stats" or something like that, which you can run whenever you need it (assuming you are using Discovery Stats, obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well robint my code is backwards compatible so if you do not run the script you will receive all bitstream hits for the OLD stats &amp; for the new ones only the ORIGINAL ones will be counted</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so sounds like next step is really to test this out on a central site (a testathon server perhaps), or commit patch &amp; then we all test it out locally</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'll apply the patch and if it doesn't appear to break anything then I'll commit it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like a good plan.  Committing it will force us all to test it :)  Plus, we can push it out to both testathon servers easier from SVN trunk.</span><br />
