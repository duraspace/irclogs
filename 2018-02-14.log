<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; On the DSpace 7 side, I don't have any significant updates to share.

<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; We have two other important meetings coming up.. DSpace Entities Mtg on Feb 23 at 15UTC, and our first ever Developer Show &amp; Tell Mtg on Feb 27 at 16UTC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; links to more info on each are on the agenda</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I also don't have any significant updates on DSpace 6.3 release efforts. Still looking for volunteers to help lead/organize. Get in touch if this is of interest to you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that's really it for topics #1 and #2 on the agenda (and the reminders).... unless others want to share updates or questions or comments on either DSpace 7 or 6.3, etc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Not hearing any...so, we'll move along to the "meat" of today's agenda, the new Java Code Style: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266">https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; As you've likely seen, I've got two PRs in progress... the actual code style itself (and corresponding Checkstyle configs): <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1895">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1895</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ New Code Style rules for DSpace "master" branch by tdonohue · Pull Request #1895 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1895">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1895</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; That PR #1895 is ready to merge, unless there are final comments/questions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; And then, there's the *massive* (literally) PR to cleanup the codebase: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1952">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1952</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ [WIP] Align Java code with new Code Style by tdonohue · Pull Request #1952 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1952">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/1952</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; And 1952 is still WIP, but it's very close....all the modules are corrected. Just need to correct the "dspace-parent" directories and turn "on" checkstyle by default</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Aw, it's only *a hundred thousand lines*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; hehe</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; it looks good to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; :$ um, yes. Hence the need for a code style.  Obviously we aren't good at code consistency ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Point.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Duralogbot, do not quote Tim</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; thank you for doing this.  It will be an improvement moving forward</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I will say this effort has taken longer than expected.  Some modules were pretty easy to cleanup... Others (:cough: dspace-api :cough:) took literally hours</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; it's funny to think of -API as a module...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, I'd like to know from you all if you have concerns/questions/comments.... My goal is to get this massive 1952 completed today/tomorrow, and hopefully merged before end of week.  BUT, I'd want your approval, and want to know if anyone has any concerns/questions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; I've built the result and it succeeds without complaint.  I looked over one of the modules and didn't see anything actually *wrong*.  There are things that'll take some getting used to, a few that I'll never get used to, and some things that I like.  I guess that makes it a good compromise, if others feel the same way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; (And I'll also be asking the same of the DSpace 7 team in tomorrow's meeting ... as I want their approval too obviously before touching most files on `master`)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I have also updated the Wiki docs to give more details of "good" and "bad" code per the new CodeStyle rules: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266#CodeStyleGuide(WIP)-DSpaceJavaStyleGuide(Adopted2018,forDSpace7.xandabove)">https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266#CodeStyleGuide(WIP)-DSpaceJavaStyleGuide(Adopted2018,forDSpace7.xandabove)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Code Style Guide (WIP) - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266#CodeStyleGuide(WIP)-DSpaceJavaStyleGuide(Adopted2018,forDSpace7.xandabove)">https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266#CodeStyleGuide(WIP)-DSpaceJavaStyleGuide(Adopted2018,forDSpace7.xandabove)</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @mwood: yes, I have the same feeling...there are things to "get used to".  But, I think that's where IDE configuration will also come in....luckily major IDEs can integrate our Checkstyle config, and warn you if you go wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; A bit of advice gleaned from a similar effort:  if we're going to be aligning broken lines like that, we need to keep identifiers reasonably short.  Otherwise we'll have places where the code will have to be rewritten slightly to make it fit all the rules.  (Another project here has one identifier that is 60 characters long!  It will only ever be seen on a line by itself...)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; so... the two code style PRs are for master... we're not backporting/applying this to 6x, correct?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @hpottinger: correct. This code style *starts* with DSpace 7. It will not be backported</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; Action: hpottinger looks relieved...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; could this make cherrypicking commits for some modules that don't change (much?) in 7 like oai-pmh, sword etc, difficult?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; or weird?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; (ie. i have a  SWORD fix for 7, will it need extra work to merge nicely into 6 now?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; That does mean of course that *forward-porting* PRs built for DSpace 6 will be slightly more painful... likely cherrypicking won't work in 90% of the cases.  You'll need to create a separate PR for 7 that uses the code style</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Weird:  yes.  Difficult:  probably not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; ok, gotcha</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; the price of progress</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; This code style PR touches quite literally 90% (or more) of all our code.  Even most of the POMs are touched. So, yes, cherrypicking likely won't work between DSpace 5/6 and DSpace 7.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; I think that's fine, 7 is kinda a different universe already</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; And even if the cherrypick is successful, CheckStyle might still fail the build... if the cherrypicked code doesn't obey the new rules ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; yeh that's why i was just thinking of those unchanged modules, OAI, SWORD, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; but not exactly a big deal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, it's the price of progress here.  We'll just need to be aware the cherrypicking won't be trustworthy between old releases and DSpace 7.  That said, the code itself (in most situations) won't be hard to adapt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; The other major thing to note is that currently open PRs on `master` may also be affected (in that they will now have conflicts that need to be resolved by a rebase).  But, I don't see any way around that one either</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But again, the price of a major effort here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; and not the first time we've affected open PRs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; yep, and that'll only get worse the longer we leave it!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; i guess that means we shouldn't be merging anything to master until after this is merged too, or we can end up making new conflicts/work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, yeah, code freeze</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, as this is a big deal...and it does affect a lot, I do want to make sure folks are OK with this.  I'd appreciate it if you either (a) give me a :+1:  (you approve), (b) ask more questions, or (c) give me a sign you have concerns still needing to be addressed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @kshepherd Yes, that's why I'm trying to finish this immediately *this week*.  Hoping to avoid much more mergers into `master`.  Not calling for a complete "code freeze", but would appreciate it if ping me before any mergers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Order with which I'm mostly happy is better than disorder.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; And I'll talk to the DSpace 7 team about this tomorrow too....as they are doing most of the (larger) work on `master` these days</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; And if you want to get a "jump" on correcting any PRs you own (or plan to create), we do already have notes on how to support CheckStyle in IntelliJ / Eclipse / Netbeans here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266#CodeStyleGuide(WIP)-IDESupport">https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=90967266#CodeStyleGuide(WIP)-IDESupport</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; I'm ready to approve, after the presentation tomorrow.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Thanks ;)  Oh, and yes, this all needs to be OK'd by DSpace 7 team... but they've also been wanting this for some time, so I expect that'll go smoothly tomorrow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, that was the major topic on our agenda for today.

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; look forward to watching the recording of the show &amp; tell</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Oh, and I just remembered I meant to report back on this 20UTC meeting time.  If you recall, I expressed concern (more like frustration) a few weeks back about whether to keep this meeting timeslot.  I've rethought that since then...I'm gonna wait to do anything until after we see how the show &amp; tell meeting plays out.  I'm hoping maybe that'll "re-energize" developers to pop their heads up, and maybe find m</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; more convenient</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I have volunteered to lead a webinar on customizing DSpace 6 in April.  I would really like to run the demo on a cloud instance of DSpace rather than using my test environment.  I hope the Show and Tell meeting will give me some insights on how to do this.  In the meantime, I am trying again to get DSpace to run on Codenvy.  Unfortunately, I do not have enough expertise in Docker to get it working.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; If a DSpace developer who understands Docker would be open to working with me for 3-4 hours on this, I think we could offer a great solution to the community.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: There's also vagrant-dspace to consider. I still find it pretty useful (when I need it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @hpottinger is the "Docker guy" (or at least I hear him talking about it the most)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Hey, @terrywbrady I can pitch in with that, though I certainly don't "understand" Docker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; @hpottinger tried to help me get it running a year ago, and we hit a wall so I have been discouraged by that option.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Docker is not particularly great on anything but Linux is one problem</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, Docker is a bit frustrating on Windows (or at least I've found it to be so)...which is why I'm using vagrant-dspace (which, at least for me, is slightly less frustrating on Windows, most of the time)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, to each their own ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Now... Docker on Linux... is like a sports car</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I can believe that, @hpottinger.  I want Docker to work, I do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Thanks @hpottinger.  Do you use Docker regularly?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; I used it a few weeks back when I was doing lots of compiling and theme work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Today I have been trying to build a docker image on my home Mac and then import it into Codenvy.  terrywbrady/dspace is the image.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I cannot get postgres properly set up to allow a user to connect to psql.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Ah, OK, let's talk. One thing you need to keep in mind, containers are not the same thing as VMs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; If you figure anything interesting out, please do document it ;)  Even just in the README of <a href="https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/dspace-dev-docker">https://github.com/DSpace-Labs/dspace-dev-docker</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; So, that ^^^ does build a single container with all the bits, but the "proper" Docker ways would be to pull in the images that are already close to what you need (like the Postgres image, and the Tomcat image) and then tie them together</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; @tdonohue is your AWS topic about straight VM provisioning? do you do anything with docker swarms using the Elastic Container Service?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; i've messed around with that at a wee bit but i've probably thrown away all my working/prototypes by now</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; ah, cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; It probably shouldn't be hyped as "AWS tools"... it's more about setting a basic DSpace up in AWS</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; It's nothing fancy...just a very basic cloud deployment like the demo.dspace.org site</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll update the description on that Wiki page to make that clearer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I am so bewildered by all these options that exist.... yet I do not know how to make any of them work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Heh, I'm still trying to figure out *why* to make any of them work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Timecheck: we are nearly out of time. I don't have any other agenda items...but, just want to be sure no one else has topics to (quickly) share</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; @mwood, here is my reason. I want to demonstrate to a new developer how to customize a bare instance of DSpace and I want to do it without needing to wipe out my existing test environment.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; I just install DSpace into a different directory and whip up a context to point to it.  I made a couple of tiny scripts to write local.cfg and a context according to my local conventions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; here's my "why": I spent several months trying to help a CS student set up IntelliJ IDEA to do DSpace. He never ever got past that state.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; I *never* want to waste time like that again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I think we underestimate what a barrier there is to getting started with the platform.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Probably.  It's still set up very much oriented toward the developer who already knows the code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I definitely agree, @terrywbrady.   I hope maybe the Dev Show &amp; Tell will inspire folks to help improve our "getting started" docs (for various IDEs, etc) and also tell us what is missing so we can start to decrease that barrier</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; There are many non-developers who are pretty technically savvy. That's the entire premise of XSLT, right? But we need to simplify the right of passage, so people can help.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I hope I did not hijack the conversation today!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, we are at the top of the hour. I'll still be around a bit, but, I'm planning to hack away at that massive PR some more in the background</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: no worries. We had a light agenda</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, feel free to continue discussion as you see fit. I'm gonna head into lurking mode now though ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; i better go earn some money</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; bye all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; (0)  You need a JDK.  Tell your package manager to install it.(1) You need one of these DBMSs.  Tell your package manager to install it.  (2) You need Tomcat or something like it.  Tell your package manager to install it.  (4) You need Git.  See above.  (5) You need DSpace.  Use Git to get it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; (6) You need Maven.  Ask your package manager.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; 2 and 6 can lead to doom</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; and 7 You need Ant</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Really?  Those were the simple bits.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Ah, yes, Ant.  Ask your package manager.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; if you depend on your package manager for Tomcat, Maven, or Ant you can end up with a mess</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Somebody needs a new package manager.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Here are some other pre-requisites: You need a server.  You need that server connected to the internet.  You need your audience to be able to access that server.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; RHEL is appealing to large IT orgs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; RHEL's approved packages are notoriously stale</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Oh, that.  Yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; Homebrew isn't much of an improvement, from time to timme</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Hardware and network access are irreducible requirements for any service.  And they're provisioned differently in each shop.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; The cloud has simplified that issue for lots of software platforms.  I wish we had that for DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;hpottinger&gt; see... Vagrant-DSpace flattens all this out to &gt; here, just install Vagrant and Virtualbox, then run `vagrant up`</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Unfortunately, when you and I tried to get vagrant dspace to run on my desktop, we were unable to get it to work.  That has led me to explore other options... options that I understood to be simpler than managing VM's within Virtual Box.  I am quite invested in DSpace, and I find the provisioning of development resources to be complicated.  What is the experience like for new developers?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; For my regular work, I have the benefit of a great set of DEV/TEST servers that are populated with relevant content for our repository instance.  When I want to do something ad-hoc that is unrelated to our repository instance, I encounter this challenge.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Now, VirtualBox is something I can deal with.  I have a virtual CentOS box to run Oracle, and a virtual Windows 10 box for the three times a year I need Windows.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; FWIW, the thinking behind `vagrant-dspace` was exactly trying to simplify the issue...make it easier to get DSpace installed to demo, do basic development on, etc.  But, I fully admit that it may not have fully met that need... I too find that when it "work" it just works (and I don't have to think about it).  But, when it doesn't (e.g. some versions of Vagrant have difficulties with other versions of Virtua</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; what is going wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; For my purposes, I still use vagrant-dspace (when I do development) cause I've found it easier for my environment...but, I don't believe in a single solution.  We definitely need multiple ways to "get started" so folks can find something easiest for them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'd love to see / find ways to enhance tools to spin up DSpace in the cloud / docker / AWS / etc.  We have bits and pieces of each, but nothing super simple yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I know that I am whining a bit, but it is for a purpose.  We are updating the code base in DSpace 7 to be developer friendly.  I think we should be thinking about this for testing/deployment as well.  I am not convinced that we should tell other developers to try to replicate what has historically worked for Terry/ Tim/Hardy/Mark/Kim.  Unfortunately, I do not have the expertise to recommend  the approach </span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; I agree that DSpace could do with some attention to production installation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: I agree with those statements completely. I just don't have an answer to that question yet. I think developers tend to come with preferences already...they might prefer an IDE over another, they might prefer Docker to Vagrant, or AWS to both.  I think my feeling is we need to find ways to help folks in through different paths...so sharing what we know is good, and hopefully we learn more about </span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, I agree completely that the path / tools of one person are not always the best path / tools of others. I have my own preferences and biases (e.g. heck I use Windows 10!  I actually find it easier than Mac or Linux for my main environment...but I also do deal heavily in Linux VMs)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; So:  everyone needs to know *what* is needed to run DSpace.  Some need help to determine *how* to get those things; others don't.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, and some could really use a simple: Press a button or two (or type a line or two) and "hey there's DSpace!".  That was the hope of vagrant-dspace, but it hasn't panned out, and it likely could be made even easier with AWS or Cloud tools</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; As one simple example of this concept... part of the Hydra-in-a-box project was creating a set of AWS CloudFormation scripts to "launch the stack" in AWS: <a href="https://github.com/hybox/aws">https://github.com/hybox/aws</a>   There's *literally* a button on that GitHub repo to launch the stack... I don't recommend pressing it though, as the full stack is a bit large / pricey.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ GitHub - hybox/aws: AWS CloudFormation templates for the Hydra-in-a-Box application stack ] - <a href="https://github.com/hybox/aws">https://github.com/hybox/aws</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, one could imagine a set of AWS CloudFormation templates to launch a simple DSpace for demo / development.  That thing doesn't exist yet, but no reason it couldn't</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; One could, and there's no reason it shouldn't exist or be used by those who want it.  But when I have used a thing like that, sooner or later it breaks, and I don't know what's inside, and the quickest way (for me) to learn what's inside is to wipe it clean and install all the pieces myself.  So, myself, I tend to avoid in-a-box.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; They used to deliver new servers to me with Netware already installed.  I always wiped the box first thing and installed Netware again, my way, and then when something went wrong I usually knew why.  Eventually they learned to just drop off the sealed maker's box.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Others have different methods.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, nothing's perfect. There's no "single solution" and anything we do build would need maintenance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; So I think we need to start with "here's what you'll need to make it run.  If that tells you all you need to know, skip a bit; otherwise, here are links to pages which show several ways that people have organized this setup work."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; If we can characterize *why* someone chose method B over method C, that might be as helpful as explaining methods B and C (which we would still do).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[22:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; We can throw a rug over some of the complexity, but it's still there.  It's just a question of when you want to face it:  now, or later.</span><br />
