<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* stuartlewis personally doesn't like it, and I'm sure it will cause a lot of confusion initially.  I'll come around in time though! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This is something I noticed during my trial upgrade this morning -- and I'm not sure if we would consider this a bug or not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger scratches his head, hmm...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: yes it is a bit inconsistent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'll investigate and email the lists for opinion</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I have a request</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I brokee the OAI Harvester in RC1, but hopefully fixed it in RC2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; If anyone is familiar with this I would be grateful if they could test</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; OAI-PMH harvester?  ORE? or both?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; a quick test could be to just harvest some content from demo.dspace.org to one's local machine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; KevinVdV: you guys use the harvester to populate some of the lab repositories, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Yeah I'm just a bit unfamiliar with harvesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; T.b.h. I don't have a clue ....... but if I find some tomorrow I will test the harvester with my local DSpace 1.8.0-RC2 setup</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I know some about it...what part was broken though? or was it all broken?  (Just trying to determine what to watch out for, if it's not obvious)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; But can't promise anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I broke it because I missed some ConfigurationManager changes when movinbg the OAI config</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; There were 2 Jira issues raised. Actually, ignore this woffle and I'll refer back to the Jira issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, so it was "all broken" then :)  I can try and do a test harvest from demo.dspace.org to my local desktop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Any tseting would be welcome. I think its fixed but not knowing it too well I may have missed something in testing. Cheers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jose_blanco&gt; I can also do a harvest.  would it be from <a href="http://demo.dspace.org/oai?verb=Identify">http://demo.dspace.org/oai?verb=Identify</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Hi jose_blanco. Its actually the Harvester that was broken so it needs to be an RC2 installation that does the harvesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; jose_blanco: yes, that's the OAI interface you can harvest from.  Just a matter of pointing the DSpace UI Harvester at it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh wait -- robint &amp; I are both "right" in a way ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; you *can* harvest *from* the demo.dspace.org site.  But, you'd want to harvest *with* a 1.8.0RC2 version of DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I hope that makes more sense)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Yep thats it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The harvest client was broken, not the harvestable service.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; The problem was I changed everything in dspace-oai, but didn't realise the oai config was used elsewhere, in the Harvester</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Anyway, thanks for all the offers but its hopefully just for reassurance</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maybe those config.s should be split?  Or are they too entangled?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; mhwood: I think they probably could/should be split in the future</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Future, agreed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, so going back to 1.8.0 stuff.  Robint, is there anything else we are "waiting on"?  Is it all just Testing &amp; Documentation reviews at this point?  Any other 1.8.0 last minute support needed from some/all of us?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I think its just lots of testing and documentation</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. robint, I recall you said you may be on holiday for some/all of next week?  did you need someone else to take over the task of "pressing the release button"  (assuming things all go as planned)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: I think its likely, but I'll let you know. Thanks.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I am around until next Tuesday so we should have a good idea by then.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, agreed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, anything else anyone has on 1.8.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hearing a lot of silence (besides the really loud wind out my window) :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; No news is good news in this case</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, definitely...ok, a parting thought or two here...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; remember, we will be looking for a volunteer (or two!) for release coordinator of the version after 1.8.0 (the exact version number is TBD -- so, I'm not calling it anything yet).  So, think about if you'd be interested in chipping in on release coordination</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Again, this next major release of DSpace will likely be in Oct 2012.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I also will mention, that it'd be great if we could find a few volunteers -- as I'd like to try and take a small step back from "backup support" on all DSpace release.  There's no "secret reason" behind this, just that I want more time to help with development or other initiatives (not that I don't enjoy helping with all releases)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, just wanted to put that all out there :)  Again, just hoping we can start to find ways that DSpace release processes don't rely so heavily on myself or DuraSpace (though we are always here if needed, obviously)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger wonders if there's a writeup of what being a RC entails...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and this is in no way saying I've been doing too much on 1.8.0 -- I think robint has been doing WONDERFULLY.  Just wanted to point on that this is likely coming down the line...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; there is...on the wiki somewhere...let me find it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/ReleaseCoordinating">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/ReleaseCoordinating</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; Agreed! robint++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ ReleaseCoordinating - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/ReleaseCoordinating">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/ReleaseCoordinating</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it's rather general though, hpottinger, but it gives an idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: Actually I agree that too much falls on you, and I think we need to explore alternatives</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; Add as always, tdonohue++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; This comes under the heading of "growing our team members".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 mhwood. :)  I need to take a step back more in the future (part of this may be me "trying to do too much")...  I'd rather turn things over more to others</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'm trying to convince myself to step forward, if not this time then the next.  The team needs people to do this, and the experience would be valuable to me.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I am also willing to this in the future but I am just a newby at the moment, so give me a year or 2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we'd love it if you could, mhwood. But, obviously I know that all of us have other things going on (work &amp; personal).  So, it's up to each of us when the time is right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I'd like to see us focus on the major features earlier in the cycle, as a team, to avoid the last minute rush</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;jose_blanco&gt; my feelings are similar to KevinVdV's</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Much of what has gone into 1.8 was ready months before</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 robint.  I also feel that way too much still happens "at the last minute"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, I realize also that it's a hard problem to fix -- everyone wants their feature to be "perfect".....could be an area where "sharing earlier" (via Git or similar tools/practices) could help</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I wonder if it would be helpful to have an "apprentice" RC kind of position?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Meanwhile, I need to go now.  'bye all!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (~mhwood@adsl-99-130-162-216.dsl.ipltin.sbcglobal.net) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; apprentice could be a good idea.  I do hope we can move towards "release teams" (2-3 people) who can collaborate to make sure it all gets done.  One of those folks could be more of an "apprentice" role</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'd be more comfortable signing up for that kind of role</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like another "special topic" we an discuss post 1.8 :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One last thing (non-DSpace really), I don't know if I ever really announced this here or not (if not I apologize).

<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Odd... so, in rc3-SNAPSHOT, the dspace-swordv2-*-classes.jar file is built into [src]/dspace-swordv2/target/ just fine. But, it is never copied to [src]/dspace/target/dspace-*-build/webapps/swordv2/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; something definitely seems broken in the building of the final "swordv2" webapp.  Seems like it could be a Maven assembly issue of some sort</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; Pardon my ignorance - but what is the dspace-assembly-plugin ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we may need to contact the "mdiggory hotline" for this one.  I suspect that robint may have accidentally "broken" things by changing the &lt;version&gt; of the 'dspace-assembly-plugin' that mdiggory tends to support</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; I'll try putting it back in my copy, see if it helps</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; the dspace-assembly-plugin is an "asynchronously" release plugin which basically supports how DSpace gets assembled by Maven.  It is essentially just Maven configs which tell Maven how to assemble DSpace.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I honestly suspect it may have something to do with the version of the 'dspace-assembly-plugin'.  I'm not sure what the difference is between version "1.2-SNAPSHOT" and "1.2"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; Looking at the commit logs (via dspace-changelog) the main difference seems to be an update to the scm location in the pom</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmm...not sure if that'd really affect what we are seeing though (seems unlikely).  I think we are likely seeing an assembly issue (cause the JAR is compiled properly, but it just isn't assembled/copied into the final 'swordv2' directory)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; unfortunately though, I need to head out of here too (pick up wife from work).   Perhaps send an email off to mdiggory &amp; robint?  I think it's <a href="https://fisheye3.atlassian.com/changelog/dspace?cs=6819">https://fisheye3.atlassian.com/changelog/dspace?cs=6819</a>  but, I could be wrong</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks stuartlewis.  glad you found it now :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;stuartlewis&gt; Nope - not found anything :(</span><br />
