<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Hi all, it's time for our weekly DSpace Developers Meeting. Today's agenda: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-08-06">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-08-06</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ DevMtg 2014-08-06 - DSpace - DuraSpace Wiki ] - <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-08-06">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2014-08-06</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Today, and for the foreseeable future, the primary topic is 5.0 release, specifically any major features we need to help get in "early", etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I also wanted to note that, currently our "Deadline for Feature Pull Requests" is just two months away. So, get your Features in soon, as you only have until early October</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and, erm, gathering many, MANY volunteers for the 5.0 RT</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, please.  ANYONE who would like to help contribute to the Release Team (need not be a Committer, but having some basic Dev chops may help at times) is welcome!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; To say this a different way...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; WE NEED MORE PEOPLE on the 5.0 Release Team.  Otherwise, we risk having TOO FEW REVIEWERS, and risk not being able to get everything we want into 5.0 Release.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (That being said, you can also help do Reviews of PRs even if you are not on the Release Team...it's just that the Release Team sometimes helps push us to get the reviews done in a timely fashion)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I am happy to help out but don't think I would be able to 'officially' volunteer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'll continue to bring this up over and over again :)  Honestly, some of your "proposed 5.0 features" will likely not make it in if we cannot find a full Release Team.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; :-) robint is being funny, as a former RC he knows he's permanently on the RT :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: any way folks can help is great. So, we'd love to have folks informally chip in too. But, we do need some more "official" folks to help drive things along (and help organize those informal participants better)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I have a slight concern that there seems to be a group that provide features and a group that get lumbered with reviewing, releasing etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Being on the release team can get in the way of doing development</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; who is on the release team for 5.0 todate?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We have two people on the 5.0 Release Team: hpottinger &amp; peterdietz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; but it doesn't have to get in the way, honest, if you just attend the meetings and help us make decisions, maybe help us crunch some data... that's all things we need</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (And to be crystal clear -- I will likely be on paternity leave around the time of 5.0.  So, I will likely not be able to help with 5.0 in the final weeks/month.  We will need to plan for others to help support.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint: I agree with your first concern. But, I don't think RT *needs* to get in the way of development, as hpottinger notes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Being on the RT will take some extra time, but the more folks we have, the less time it will pull from your given week.  And RT work mostly "ramps up" as feature development is "ramping down" (i.e. post-Feature PR freeze)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Just grumbling a little, don't take it seriously</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-green">* awoods (~awoods@c-67-165-245-76.hsd1.co.comcast.net) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I hope robint knows I was just kidding, though, as a former RC, he *may* get asked the kinds of questions we normally ask tdonohue when the release date approaches.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I really hate to harp on this every week...but we do need more folks to actively participate.  Releases don't "magically" happen...and while having some folks concentrating on just building new cool features is good, we need to ensure we are all helping chip in (on occasion) to help releases go smoothly.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; robint makes a good point about the same set of names winding up on the RT all the time.  There is effort this time to resist that and attract some new names.  So far that hasn't worked.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood ++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Dont worry hpottinger :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If I could, I'd start a "release team rotation" and ask everyone to be on the Release Team once every 2-4 years.  But, I unfortunately don't have direct control over your time ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or maybe not "unfortunately" ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In any case...I guess you all probably get the point by now &amp; I'll remind you again next week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: I appreaciate you making this a priority. I *know* there are people out there who can't wait to volunteer. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; moving along, are there any 5.0 related topics anyone has to bring up?   Any feature updates or features "waiting in the wings" that we should be expecting/preparing for?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; @mire has their ORCID work, but I think we're waiting on a nod for Mirage2?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I think with mirage2, there's still some followup fixes, based on the discussion last week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Well, it's still possible to review the ORCID work, right?  Even if it cannot be "merged" until Mirage 2?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; tdonohue: that's a good point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; We are preparing the ORCID pull request &amp; it should be reviewable without Mirage 2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I have a wee Google Analytics reporting feature, but it is also dependent on Mirage2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV: sounds great!  Any idea of the timeline of the Pull Request?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Mirage 2 support will be added as a “bug fix patch” later on ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger gets giddy when the talk turns towards new features coming up for review.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well I hope to get the ORCID pull request fired this week (but not making any promises)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; KevinVdV: noted. ;-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: ok, done. I've marked 1641 for 5.0, added you as "assigned" (since you wrote the code) and marked "code review needed"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Its based off of the lyncode approach, but I've been refactoring it, and adding to it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; peterdietz: so, it's based off of DSPR#61?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Dynamic config is going to ripple through a lot of code.  It requires new thinking about how one handles configuration data:  fetch it when you need it, don't cache locally.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; yeah, I checked out his code, and then worked from there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The code using ConfigurationService is probably following the "new" pattern pretty well, but code using ConfigurationManager will need close inspection.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; (I think mhwood just volunteered to review)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I've made all method calls in ConfigurationManager end up calling config = new DSpace().getConfigurationService;   config.getProp(...)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; peterdietz: glad to hear its leveraging the COnfigurationService.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; peterdietz: that would be an ideal design...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; heh, mdiggory the first thing I did was re-read the Tao of Services.. I should get a leather bound edition of that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yay, DS-1390 will soon be obsolete.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds like some much needed, excellent work, peterdietz</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I can't stand hearing my voice anymore....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; people with local developments might need a big heads up on the dynamic configuration thing too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; yeah. if this adventure (dynamic config) doesn't get in, then I'll just cherry-pick the other fixes in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maybe break the work down that way anyway.  Anything that can stand alone and improve the product should go ahead and move in when it's thought to be working.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; peterdietz: Cool video, I think it also features your family in the background :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; More small merges, fewer big ones, earlier exposure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; yeah. I have a nasty habit of recording screencasts when we're in the car.. VW is very sound proof. The kids are usually quiet. And we've been doing 7 hour drives lately</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; ...plus the new MBP battery lasts an entire day</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; A mixed blessing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The number of things we have "in mention" here for 5.0 is astounding...a lot of things that have been mentioned off &amp; on for some time (both by Devs &amp; RepoMgrs): Bulk Upload via UI, Metadata For All, Dynamic Configs, tracking file downloads in Google Analytics, not to mention a cleaner UI in Mirage v2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; The battery that is!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; It's a pretty exciting release, 'tis true.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; So, I've just dug into my code, and I've discovered that maybe I'm not as far behind as I thought I was. i.e. booting xmlui says:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; org.dspace.browse.BrowseException: Browse Index configuration is not valid: webui.browse.index.2 = author:metadata:dc.contributor.*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; but the config says:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; peterdietz:peterDSpace peterdietz$ /dspace/bin/dspace config -g -p webui.browse.index.2</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; We are at only about 5 mins to go. I think we've done a good amount of "info sharing here" on 5.0 hopeful features, which is excellent</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, as aschweer noted, maybe time to mention dynamic config. and its implications for local code on -tech?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; The issue is that it is treating this as multiple value's for the config property.. And I don't think we allow for splittable properties, so treat the comma as a literal</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I'm not sure I see all of the implications of the dynamic configs, other than its probably going to break in random places, depending on things holding on to values..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's quite enough, though.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; But, we use caches that way, so, its likely to just create a million endless things to chase down...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; just thinking of my own local code, it means I need to know that I'll need extra dev cycles when doing the upgrade to make sure I don't hold on to config values</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; so I guess I'm saying, giving people a heads-up (and this may not need to be now already, just mention it prominently along with new features) lets them make better estimates of how long it might take them to do the upgrade</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Right. I think right now this isn't DB-driven configs.. That has complicated implications. I'll follow lyncodes route, where it writes to the config files after every config change</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; but ConfigurationManager at the moment doesn't read the config file every time you ask it for a value, right? it reads the config once on start-up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; I've got no promises that dynamic configs make it to dspace 5. Would be very nice, but I've got my fingers crossed that someone will be telling me to go on holiday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; correct, once on startup. I also am not sure if that's once per the kernel, or once per each webapp..</span><br />
