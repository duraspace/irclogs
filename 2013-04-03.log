<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This was an issue I had highlighted in the agenda as possibly warranting a 3.2 bug-fix-only release.   Essentially it sounds like there may be a few things to try and fix with 'build.properties' before 4.0 next fall/winter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Did you have any specific updates on this ticket, pbecker?  I notice you've been involved with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; As I already wrote in a comment to the ticket, I think we should split it into to tickets.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; One problem is in DSpace directly, the other one is with the filtering in maven.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; makes sense to me. it does sound like two separate issues (and thanks for the pull request for one of those -- we'll have to get that reviewed quickly)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I think I fixed the problem within DSpace (see the pull request, mentioned in the comments to the ticket).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; And, if I'm understanding, the Maven filtering issue doesn't have a solution/resolution yet?  Or at least no one has figured it out?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; The pull request should be quite easy to review. DSpace does not read some files with the correct encoding (UTF-8).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; The problem with maven is that it reads the build.properties as if it were ISO-latin1 encoded.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; As far as I know, there is no fix for the maven problem yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; At a glance the pull request looks reasonable to me (haven't tested it though, but it seems logical by looking at it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, if we make 1469 the ticket for the problem fixed by pull 199, where dspace.cfg is read correctly, that deals with part of the problem, and then make a new ticket for the issue with build.properties filtering</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; that's a shame that there doesn't seem to be a Maven filtering fix yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- yea, that seems reasonable.  Split out the Maven filtering part into a separate ticket</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; perhaps we should make a small example and ask at maven project for help?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; if we fix the problem within DSpace, we would have a work around at least.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I like closing existing tickets, and leaving new tickets open</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I noticed that Steve Swinsburg mentioned that the 'maven-resources-plugin' has an encoding setting (in the comments of Ds-1469).  It sounds like that hasn't worked based on helix84's tests.   We may want to do a few more tests of that setting, and if necessary we can report a bug to the 'maven-resources-plugin'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I tried it also, it didn't helped.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; But I do not know maven and pom files very well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmm..it's possible there's a bug in the maven-resources-plugin then..or we haven't figured out the correct setting.  According to the docs for "maven-resources-plugin", it is supposed to support UTF-8: <a href="http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/faq.html#What_encoding_values_are_allowed">http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/faq.html#What_encoding_values_are_allowed</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I don't know the answer to the Maven Resources issues, but I'd be willing to look into it a bit...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I do think splitting 1469 is a good idea, no reason to hold up a partial fix</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger - I agree completely.  We should associate Ds-1469 with just the fix in pull 199, and open a new ticket for the 'maven-resource-plugin' stuff</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd be willing to open the new ticket for the maven-resource-plugin stuff (and even try a few tests myself)...if someone else will handle pull #199 and Ds-1469</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; should mention, at a glance pull #199 looks reasonable to me...I just haven't tested it out (but I'm assuming pbecker has, of course)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I figured you did..thanks for verifying though :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok.  I'll open a new ticket for the maven-resources-plugin encoding issues after this meeting (and link it to Ds-1469)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks for all your help on this pbecker..much appreciated.  Hopefully we'll find a way to fix the Maven part (or report a bug back to the Maven project team)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; hi helix84</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint -- I think the build.properties stuff has still been a worthwhile change...it's just not as "smooth" as it could be quite yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I like your thinking!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I really like the build.properties stuff.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; It makes it easy to setup a little test instance.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Oh well, that is good to hear pbecker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I *love* the .properties changes, one of the main reasons I'm pushing for an upgrade to 3.x for my repository</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; it makes setting things up so much more straightforward: checkout, copy one file, done</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I like the *.properties stuff too. It's only been frustrating around this UTF-8 stuff, and when you stumble on a config that you *wish* was in build.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; build.properties is feeling the love</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; btw -- I likely will have a few small tweaks to suggest in nearish future around things to *add* to build.properties, based on my work with DSpace 3.1 for our new DSpaceDirect service</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (it's minor stuff..nothing super exciting, just stuff that I wish was in that build file)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in any case...bringing us back to agenda (at least a bit back)..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we're a smallish group still today...but, I did want to float the idea of a possible 3.2 bug-fix-only release</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm OK with a 3.2 for the changes you mention in the agenda, tdonohue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; namely to possibly fix these build.properties issues (Ds-1469, future ticket on encoding issues, DS-1525?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1525">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1525</a> ] - [#DS-1525] build.properties not interpolated properly when building with Maven 3 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; does anyone remember the reason why it's not allowed to just filter *any* configuration property from build.properties and have the rest fall back? I remember it was a design limitation but I don't know the exact reason.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84...technically you can add anything you want to build.properties...you just need to replace the "default value" in dspace.cfg with ${propname}... that way it gets filled out by build.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; the design limitation is that "${propname}" value needs to be in dspace.cfg (or whatever other config -- it also works for the configs under /config/modules/)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; But what for would we then need a dspace.cfg in the source directory?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure if that makes sense?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, and then by putting everything to build.properties we'd effectively have another dspace.cfg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; helix84: yes, it only makes sense if it remains a smallish subset</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; What I like on build.properties it that it shows me the few properties I really have to change, whenever I set up a new DSpace instance to test something...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- yea, exactly.  You don't want *everything* in build.properties...you just want to main fields there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but what I'm asking is - is there a way to have a default value for a property if it's not in build.properties? (there is a common problem that breaks the build if you comment out any property from build.properties)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 : unfortunately I think that's a design limitation of build.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; default is build.properties, use someotherfile.properties to override</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; the only other way I could think of having a "default value" that is not in build.properties is to actually hardcode some default values in the Maven pom.xml itself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; helix: what is the reason to comment a properties out? you can always overwritte it in dspace.cfg...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; pbecker: if you comment it out by accident instead of leaving it empty, it breaks the build and it can be quite hard to figure out if you don't know about it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I remember the messages don't point to build.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; okay</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; it's a bit of a trap, since the comments for dspace.cfg (ported over the build.properties) suggest (or at least used to suggest) that you comment out a setting if you didn't need to use it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I think these are just limitations with the current build.properties design.  I agree it'd be nice to also be able to comment out fields in build.properties...but, not sure how easy that would truly be to implement.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'm still hoping Joao will come up with something completely new (working title - dynamic configurations). the idea is that all you would need at DSpace startup amounts to approximately what's now in build.properties</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, are there other tickets out there we should consider for a 3.2 release?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; could ds-1459 be something for 3.2?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; oh, there are a few we pushed back that were scheduled for 3.1 but unresolved</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- yea, that'd be nice.  We've talked about moving more configs to the Database (or similar) for a long time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I think the new UI will be dependent on it, so I really think we could have it for 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: Ds-1459 looks like it's already been committed to the 3.x branch...so, yes, it'd be in the 3.2 release</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; it's part of 3.x branch, just checked it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; you can although considering it as a bug fix. With the new OAI interface it was not possible to check dissemination crosswalks anymore. this is the fix for it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; sorry, i'm trying to check just my jira connection seems very lazy today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Was the original fix commited to both master and 3.1, but the later fix to just master?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; The pull request was for the master only.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; That's the reason why I asked if it could be something for 3.2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I see a total of 4 related commits -- two to master and two to dspace-3_x branch.   So, it looks like it was merged into both.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in any case, we can probably figure this all out later.  The reality is that currently Ds-1459 *is* on 3.x branch...so as-is, it would be released in 3.2, unless for some reason we decided to remove it from that 3.x branch.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I really don't remember why I commited it to 3_x. I didn't mention it in the Jira issue, so it might have been a mistake.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; well, it's probably in a "grey-ish" area between improvement and bug fix.  It may not hurt to release in a 3.2 anyhow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 release it anyhow</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I just saw, that it seems already to be in 3.1?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (especially since, as pbecker noted, this feature *used to exist*...it only stopped working in 3.0 with the new OAI-PMH interface)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hm.. we may want to create a ticket around that.  Seems like it *should* be either a feature of the logger or some sort of "listener" that emails when errors happen</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd like to see that patch too ;)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; example usage</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; sorry guys, my java-fu is still weak</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; only one way to make it stronger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I made the first step - I installed Eclipse. I can't get to the second one - to run it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I feel your pain, IntelliJ IDEA + Oracle was a big hurdle for me to jump</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; see...the problem is that you started with Eclipse (kidding ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; what I was told by a person closely familiar with the matter, it's not all java applications that are a bother to develope because of looong edit-compile-run cycle, it's just DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; My wife is reminding me that I need to pick up the kids, I gotta run, but helix84, if you want to compare notes on this potential patch, let's move it to e-mail and keep talking</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I suggest to make a Jira ticket instead, I don't have any cycles to devote to that at this time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd say definitely stick it in JIRA.  You can still compare notes later if needed, but best get it logged first</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84, if you can spare the time to do a brain dump of your research today and ideas for what needs to happen, I will take the ball and run with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: btw the reason I chose Eclipse instead of NetBeans/Idea is that Eclipse is recommended for Android development. And that would be a useful skill to have these days.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; we have random error reports from repo managers, I've got 'em trained to give me the stack trace, but it would be helpful if I already have the trace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'll file the ticket, I just don't think there will be anything there besides what you've just seen here. Don't let me keep you, Hardy.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea. I'm just teasing you, helix84.  I understand there are good reasons to use Eclipse.  Someday maybe I'll try it again and see if I like it better.  I just recall that about 3-5 years ago the majority of DSpace Committers all used Eclipse.  Now, almost no one does.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK, make the ticket, I've got a local ticket for the work in our own ticket system, I'll link them and will try to get some cycles for it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; gotta run, bye!</span><br />
