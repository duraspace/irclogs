<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, it'd get a +1 to me too.  I think mapping should be available under "edit item" as well</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, we'll move on for now.  Ds-902 summary:  some support, seems sensible.  Just needs a volunteer &amp; code (aschweer's comment implies she may have something here)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- yea, we're not trying to schedule these for 1.8.1 -- just doing a general review to see if we like the idea and/or can find volunteers to look at it more</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, wait. looks like a placeholder for larger work.  Any brief comments on Ds-908?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I like the general idea of Ds-908, but we'd just need to figure out a way to implement and move existing embargoes forward.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, since this is a placeholder, we'll just move on for now...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; next, DS-909</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-909">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-909</a> ] - [#DS-909] Collection DEFAULT_ITEM_READ and DEFAULT_BITSTREAM_READ handling - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; not sure I understand this one?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds like two issues:  collection UI is too simple; display of access restrictions is broken.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; should we split this apart &amp; describe them better then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Collection UI can't adjust default READ and WRITE separately, but other UI can, and the result can't be show in Collection.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maybe what's needed is a simple way to put a widget on a page which means "take me to Rights Management, focused on this object."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; And a widget on the RM page meaning, "take me back where I came from."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I like the general idea.   Though I wonder if a "simple fix" is to just duplicate a Collection's "Default read access" setting under "Assign Roles" so that it's "Default Item read access" and "Default Bitstream read access"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Hmmm.  "UI too simple" really covers both, though.  From the description, there just aren't enough widgets on the Collection page to express the rights situation.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yeah, that sounds like a good quick fix.  Rights needs an extensive rethink at some point (see previous issue) but this will at least avoid confusing people so much.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ablemann&gt; just want to chime in with a +1 for Ds-908. crontabs for checking dates complicates installs and creates situations that are inconsistent.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, it looks like the "Assign Roles" page just needs to have a widget that covers everything you can do on the "Edit Authorization Policies directly" page.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Ok this is where I come in and comment about the the "Assign Roles" Page being a poor design...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; feel free to redesign it ;) I agree it's not the prettiest nor easiest to use.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the Role and its context is the Resource Policy being added to the Collection, just like all the others...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; seems like things would be alot more intuitive if you had the desription and usage associated with the policy and its view rather than hardcoded into a hacky summary view page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; plus these summary view pages like "Assign Roles" are non-extensible</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If anyone has some ideas on how best to redesign this "Assign Roles" page, I'd be all in favor of someone submitting a mockup.  I think we've just been "patching" it cause we haven't figured out a different way to display this info</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (i.e. if anyone is interested, feel free to do a mockup of how this could look.  Then we could find folks to try and rebuild it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I hear ya</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I have an internal ticket to look at changing the wildcard policy admin tool, which is kinda sorta related to all this</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  we're running long here on just JIRA reviews.  So, I'd suggest we wrap up discussion of Ds-909 and minimally post this chat discussion as a comment.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- yes, sounds related.  If you find yourself wanting to do some redesign/mockups, let us know (or just do it and submit your ideas back)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: I like the general idea.  Though I wonder if a "simple fix" is to just duplicate a Collection's "Default read access" setting under "Assign Roles" so that it's "Default Item read access" and "Default Bitstream read access"?  &lt;--- seems sufficent for the moment...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmmm... to me it seems like a simple fix could be for the UI to do some simple date validation on the embargo date?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; But what if the item remains in the workflow a bit long ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; &amp; the embargo date is passed that way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The UI can't do it without help from the embargo code, since the format is so general.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, yea, I can see that point KevinVdV</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I admit, I don't know this area of the codebase very well at all -- just brainstorming</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It's coming back to me.  The EmbargoLifter is pluggable, and you can put literally anything in the metadata field (which is also configurable) so long as it has meaning to the lifter.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I agree that validation is in order, but the UI will have to call the embargo code to ask whether a given value makes sense.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, then the validation function goes on the lifter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; another crazy brainstorm: is there any way to "rollback" from an item-install error.  So, what I mean by that is that if an error happens during the "Item Install", you rollback to putting the item back into workflow/workspace and display an error on the UI / and log it too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I suppose there's no easy way to just reject an uninstallable item and move on?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I have to say I am not a fan of just UI checking the embargo, because the time of entering the embargo differs from the time from item instal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; install</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; "These objects could not be restored:  type ID reason"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- would it be possible to just "catch" this error in the UI though, and display a message (like mhwood suggests):  "This object could not be installed: [reason]"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I am willing to look into it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it's not really validating anything then -- it's just catching the error, and letting the person fix the issue before they hit "Submit" again</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Isn't the original issue about restoring an AIP?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood? no, I think it's just submitting an item?  DS-1082</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1082">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1082</a> ] - [#DS-1082] Invalid embargo causes item archival to crash. - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, I was reading too much into the word "archived".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;ablemann&gt; if it's invalid does that mean that it's necessarily in the past? can you just call the lifter?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- yea, in this case, by "archived" we really mean the item is "installed into the DSpace 'archive'"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; @ ablemann Well but if an embargo WAS in place, it must be there for a reason.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, so the workflow code should just hand it back and say, "can't be installed, fix this:"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ablemann -- it looks like there are two cases.  The date is invalid, or the date is in the past.  In the latter case, the date may be "in the past" cause the item had to go through workflow review (and for some reason that review took longer than the initially set embargo period)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; It shouldn't throw an exception all the way up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood +1  yea, it should report "please fix this:" (in some way).  It seems like that could happen from *either* workflow or just normal submission though (if in the normal submission process someone enters a bad/invalid date)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I am also a fan of setting the embargo to infinite or something like that &amp; sending an alert email to somebody</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I wonder why "embargo date already passed" is an error.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- in my mind that's a good "backup".  But, it'd be better to force the person to fix it immediately (as the person you email may not even know what the embargo really should be set to)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Theoretically it may not be a date at all.  You could have a lifter that reads a URL out of the metadata and makes a query to some publisher's site to ask if it's okay yet, or some such.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- nice idea, but I don't think many publishers tell you in a machine-readable fashion how long the embargo needs to be ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I was assuming that the response would be "yes/not yet".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  so, it sounds like the status of this bug is still a bit up-in-the-air.  Do we wait on this?  Do we just continue with 1.8.1 whether it includes Ds-1082 or not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; My point is that the embargo code really is that general.  The rest of DSpace doesn't know what the embargo setting means.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; "Throws an exception all the way up to the user" is a bug and could be fixed, I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Daft question time - so the value doesn't have to be a date ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; At least not a typical date format ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; +1 to fix it based on KevinVdV and RRodgers recs.  suggest that there be a value for "forever" that is the safe default...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; in the default embargo implementation, I think it does need to be a date, doesn't it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; As I understand it, no.  The lifter that comes with DSpace thinks it's a date.  But another lifter could expect something different.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Could just be text that i interpretable by the lifter ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes, the non-date values are used to calculate the date.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; In that case is InstallItem wrong to assume it will be a date ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Uh, I think there's a lifter that understands things like "N month".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Ah sorry, just read the code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That's what I've been saying:  InstallItem has to ask the configured embargo code whether the value maks sense.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; the lifter returns the date</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; (aside, this is why I'm recommending using Polices with ranges for embargo. these can be open ended... "Restrict" ResourcePolicy with no start/end date)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (aside as well -- I like the idea of using Policies for embargo -- we just need an implementation &amp; a way to convert current embargoes to Policy-based embargoes)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. should we set this aside for now?  Sounds like hopefully we can have something simple ready for 1.8.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; +1 to suggested fix. Seems a pragmatic solution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Is it a lot of work to just catch the exception, refuse to install, and tell the user "sorry, needs fixing"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; i'm fine with suggested fix.  My only other idea was to just find a way to "catch" the error in the UI and tell the user to "fix the embargo date".  But, either way is fine by me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; +1 to the fix suggested on the ticket, and I really like the idea of policy-based embargo</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Well that depends if the UI is doing the item install &amp; it isn't an item import script or something of the like</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Plus the metadata input screens don't currently allow for error messages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; They just check if something is present or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; for an item import script (or non-UI stuff), I actually don't care if it throws an exception to the user. As long as the exception is useful</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint -- you misunderstand. The error message would be displayed once the item is actually *finished/submitted*.  So, as the item is being installed, if the error occurs, we could try and catch it and jump the user back to the end of the submission process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (admittedly, not sure if that's possible -- but that is the idea)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; ah ok</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; again, I think either approach is fine.  But, we might want to do a quick investigation on whether it's possible to catch this error easily (if so, then it may be even easier to just jump the user back to the end of the submission process in the UI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, should we move on to the other open issue: DS-1076  (we're already running over in time)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; T.b.h. I don't know if I can find the time to get the UI stuff done for DSpace 1.8.1. .......</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV: so you think the "forever" embargo is much easier?  if so, I'm ok with it.  I just wasn't sure it actually was easier.  Or, the other option is to just delay DS-1082 until 1.8.2 (if we have one)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Looks like 1082 still needs picked up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Doh! 1076</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, before we talk about Ds-1076, I'm going to sidetrack this discussion a bit (since I know some folks will need to leave soonish).   This is my *last* developer meeting until the week of Jan 9 (I'm on leave until then).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, one question to ask why you are all still here:   Do any of you want to take on the role of leading these meetings?  (Or even rotate that role amongst some of you?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Alternatively, I can ask bradm if he'd be willing to come back for a while and help lead/organize meetings in coming weeks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I would do next weeks</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (I just wanted to make sure that we had a plan for coming weeks -- as I'm going to be 100% offline starting Dec 14 until at least Jan 9)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can take a week.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Do we feel that there are any weeks when attendance would be unproductively small?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, so do you all want to organize it amongst yourselves then?  there's 4 weeks:  12/14, 12/21, 12/28, 1/4</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm guessing the meeting on 12/28 may be "unproductively small" (we tend to not really meet between Xmas and New Years most years)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; If noone objects I'll do next week and then pass the baton on to whoever would like to do the following week ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; and so on...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If we're going to meet on 12/21 I could take that one.  I may not be available on 1/4 as we have "Organizational Week" the first week of the year -- staff meetings and workshops for several days.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good to me, robint</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; mhwood: that sounds fine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; "pass the baton" sounds like a good plan.  If any "big decisions" happen, just be sure to send a note along to dspace-commit or similar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. so, should we move back to DS-1076, which I think is assigned to PeterDietz?  Any quick updates or help needed?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1076">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1076</a> ] - [#DS-1076] Visualisation of static pages is broken in 1.8 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; When is 1.8.1 planned to be released?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Its not fixed yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it sounded like robint was hoping for mid-Dec? is that right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I finish up at the end of next week so if its after thaat then someone else would need to do it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Personally I think it would be worth doing a release at the end of next week with whatever is ready</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (though if we really need to delay until Jan, that's fine really -- the amount of people who really want to install DSpace in mid-Dec is probably rather low)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: good point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That being said, I'd personally prefer to release next week as soon as we can though (as we've fixed some significant bugs/errors already, and we can always do a 1.8.2).  But, I'll leave it up to all of you :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; My vote is for a release late next week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, PeterDietz -- any quick updates you'd like to share?  Or is Ds-1076 not likely to be fixed until Jan?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'd vote to release next week. I'll look at this issue, try to get something this week ready for it. Does mdiggory have any code to send in as well?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz -- IIRC, last week we determined that mdiggory's work was actually a new feature, and there may be a much more simplistic way to just do a quick fix for 1.8.1 (and leave bigger changes for the next major release)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; you might want to check the discussion logs from last week's meeting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I can help with testing 1076 if needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I can test too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; right,</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Wasn't the other plan to just make a servlet that has a list of places to look, and map it from one or more places in URLspace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; so, i'm trying to understand better... none of Ds1076 code is actually in 1.8.0?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; its all here... <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Manakin+theme+tutorial#Manakinthemetutorial-Addingstaticpages">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Manakin+theme+tutorial#Manakinthemetutorial-Addingstaticpages</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; If I understand correctly there is no "static" page solution in 1.8.0. just a fix that breaks this demonstration code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; That was my understanding.  People have found ways to hack statics in, but they were never designed in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; seems more like the demonstration code needs improvement, not changes to DSpace 1.8.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If I'm reading it correctly, Ds-1076 actually says 1.8.0 *breaks* the "static" page demo code that used to work in 1.7.x</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; although, yes I agree having a better static solution inplace out of the box is highly sought</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; the description of Ds-1076 actually says the demo code no longer works in 1.8.0 because it was accidentally broken by the fix to DS-768</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; thats because the demo code actually utilized the "bug" to accomplish what it does ;-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok.  well, if there's a better way to do static pages in 1.8.0, then we could just change the docs.  (I admit, I don't know this area well)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Would fixing the demo code actually be quicker than writing something which implements:  if you want to display a static page, put it *here* and link to it *here*.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Actually the solution is to write a better "About.java"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; About.java --&gt; rename to "StaticPage.java"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; add code that looks for file in static directory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right -- this is the same discussion as last week :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; returns nothing otherwise</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; That would be a new feature, not a bug fix.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; I've got to go. Cheers all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; And tdonohue: hope all goes well !</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; thanks robint :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: its not even a new feature if someone just adds it to the tutorial....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* robint (52292725@gateway/web/freenode/ip.82.41.39.37) Quit (Quit: Page closed)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I just wonder if the new feature wouldn't be quicker and easier than the fix.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Its an addon aspect for DSpace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; someone can make a modules project for it. release it separately to maven, if folks want to use it, they just add the dependency to their xmlui</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; if the "new feature" is one class that is small/quick/easy/well tested, we could still let it slide.   We just need approval of robint &amp; a majority of us, as we really don't want to open the floodgates to new features.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (i.e. technically, this "new feature" is actually still fixing a bug that exists.  So, I'd be OK with it as long as this doesn't snowball into something larger)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I like the module option idea, but just rolling it into 1.8.1 seems straightforward, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I just vote for whatever seems "simplest".  If that happens to be the "StaticPage.java" route, I'd be OK with it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Need to run, sorry guys</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; A whole aspect/template team just to blurt some .xhtml file to the browser seems like overkill.  Did I misunderstand what we mean by "static"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* KevinVdV (~KevinVdV@d54C14B50.access.telenet.be) Quit (Quit: KevinVdV)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue sorry we are going over by so much today -- I just didn't want to cut short these discussions.  But, if you need to leave, obviously feel free!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 mhwood. I agree this shouldn't be a whole new aspect.  Everything doesn't need it's own aspect, especially something this obvious.  I'd bet most sites would want the ability to add static pages &amp; expect this out-of-the-box.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood, it seems like a lot of engineering to invoke, but on the plus side, cocoon will happily cache the heck out of that static file :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The filesystem will already cache it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Cocoon caching, it seems to me, is for things created on the fly, identically, more than once.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, so PeterDietz and/or mdiggory -- do we have a direction/ideas for Ds-1076?  Or is this still needing more thought/discussion?  I'm not sure if you know which direction you plan to head with this or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; If the file is going to go through the whole pipeline, then we'll need to specify what it can contain and how it is altered along the way out.  I thought that "static page" meant "just ship this file with HTTP around it".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- I have same understanding. My idea of "static page" is also "just ship this file with HTTP around it"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think static in this case means "static blob with my theme wrapped around it"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; hpottinger's view point is how I interpret this as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So that's why we have so many ideas bumping into each other.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, ok. I see.  Yea, that makes sense hpottinger</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:41]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* cbeer (~cbeer@198.147.175.203) Quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, do we have a direction here that makes sense to you, PeterDietz (since you are currently assigned to Ds-1076)?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I've got in my head how it is expected to function. I'm just running thinking about what implementation will get us there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So, I would say I have what I need.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and two volunteers for testing :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:44]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* eddies1 (~eddies@unaffiliated/eddies) Quit (Quit: Leaving.)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-green">* eddies (~eddies@unaffiliated/eddies) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok, sounds good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; So, demo.dspace.org/xmlui/some-new-page is going to be caught by Kim's Fresh 404's, hack#1 is assuming it can intercept that DRI, and replace the title and add some html body.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; May I suggest calling it "external static content" if it's going to be wrapped in DHTML.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I think the bare-minimum changes for end-site is going to be to add some map:match pattern for their various static url's. Then they can mess with the xsl to add the body/content. Whether that be embedded content in the xsl, or external-static-content from some-static-page.xhtml in the static directory</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'll get to coding then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Thank you!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; fyi -- just cause I had a vague memory of static pages in the past, I recalled we actually already have a way to display fully static HTML (not with the theme wrapped around):  <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-97">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-97</a>   (src/main/webapp/static/), e.g. robots.txt</span><br />
