You should have already seen the email, but we are having a  few "DSpace Future Directions" joint meetings with DCAT &amp; Committers to go over some of the feedback that DuraSpace has heard from its Sponsorts &amp; Registered Service Providers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So again, we'd love to have you all join one of those meetings (no need to join both, unless you really really wanted to)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; If there are any questions about these meetings though, I'd be glad to answer them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Got one on my calendar, now I just need to send Skype some money.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Also, it's worth mentioning, the discussion will be higher level, if it isn't clear...we won't be digging deep into tech stuff and will try to avoid having others do so.  Essentially the goal is to get all the feedback out there and start to analyze whether there are common concerns we can start to form a project (or multiple) around</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, the main topic for today obviously (as many folks start filtering in) is 3.0 release status &amp; updates</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, it's OK for a bit of the technical go color our approach to the high level discussion, yes?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- for that DSpace Futures Discussions, you are more that welcome to have tech stuff "color" the high level discussion.  But we just want to keep things at a higher level, and avoid digging deep on one single topic</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (as we only have one hour for the meeting, and want to make the most of our time)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok...moving along to 3.0 stuff &amp; next steps...we've completed the 2nd Testathon...there seemed to be less reported bugs overall, but we still have quite a few that seem to be open.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we're down to 29! :)  (it is decreasing...just not so rapidly)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; tdonohue: still seems (because of the frequency and open list) that we are not ready to leap toward a final release.  anybody else have feelings on this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; The biggest group seem to be relted to versioning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; related</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; correct, some of the biggest seem related to versioning, which is also a good reason why I wanted to bring forth a recommendation (suggested by mdiggory initially) to *DISABLE* versioning by default in 3.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm working on DS-1174 today</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; tdonohue: Could we then proceed without reolving the related Jira issues?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (As much as I like versioning as a feature...and still want to promote it heavily in 3.0, I think we need to warn folks about some of the issues related to it)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Stick a big warning on it - this feature is beta and buggy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; robint -- yes, if we decided to disable versioning in 3.0, then I'd suggest both DS-1374 and DS-1382 become "known issues" and get rescheduled for 3.1 or 4.0</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: yep, we already have the mobile theme with the nice beta sticker</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- yea, that's a way to put it... "Versioning" is in beta...it works, but here's some of the "known issues/complications"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; KevinVdV -- yea, I agree.  Even if we slap beta on Versioning, we still need to fix Ds-1363 and any other bugs in the versioning system itself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I will attempt to fix them in coming week ..... Just been so busy lately</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; KevinVdV: let us know if you are struggling for time and maybe others can help out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The biggest versioning issue here is that Ds-1382 seems REALLY COMPLEX....it's essentially rewriting a good chunk of the AIP Backup &amp; Restore (and then making sure it's backwards compatible).  It's not doable in the near term, and I'm not sure we want to hold up 3.0 for it.  But, it is very important issue to make users aware of.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so while sands is still here, let me ask the RT - are we still going for the planned release date?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Might I ask what the date is ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes the planned release date is currently set at FRIDAY :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; yee haw!</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; Then I guess not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; Yeah I'm not going to get there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sands&gt; i would vote not.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; okay</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; How much time is needed for things that *must be fixed*, then?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So...what is a more reasonable date?  We really should try and keep pushing to get this wrapped up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; considering the bugs we have left, does a week's extension sound enough?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; We have two blockers, one unassigned.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i wouldn't recommend extending it more at once, we may reconsider again in a week</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue notes that next week (specifically Thurs &amp; Fri) many folks in the USA will be off work...for Thanksgiving Holiday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;KevinVdV&gt; I will give it my everything to attempt to fix.... Might need testers</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: so what about the following monday/tuesday?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;robint&gt; mhwood: the unassigned blocker is the caching issue, which I think we agreed could be rescheduled if we had to</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; The holiday in the USA only extends through Thurs &amp; Fri.  Most folks (self included) will return to work on Mon, Nov 19</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; KevinVdV when you're ready for testers, just ask on one of the mail lists (dspace-release would get my attention, but -commit would probably be better)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; tdonohue meant to say: The holiday in the USA only extends through Thurs &amp; Fri.  Most folks (self included) will return to work on Mon, Nov 26</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and who wants to do the honors?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i think we should really try to keep that one</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, it's too late for 3.0.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i was thinking of heretically suggesting to put it into 3.0 and hurry with 3.1 O:-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'd rather do the opposite...schedule for 3.1, and if any "brave" folks can start running it in production 3.0, they can let us know by 3.1 if it has proven to be stable</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'm not sure how else we're going to get it tested enough</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'll take that bet, will shoehorn 1205 into our 3.0 upgrade</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i'll do that too unless i forget</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it's a deal, then</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Sounds good...we'll reschedule Ds-1205 for 3.1 then</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well i was thinking - is the issue whether TXT are accessible or just whether Google Scholar should give priority to the PDFs? Because I'd answer the first question no, it's how we designed it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In this previous thread, PeterDietz said he thought it had to do with the HTTP 301 Redirect that the XMLUI does by default...but, I'm also not sure if that's the full issue here</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; also notice the second email in the thread from Reinhard</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- my first question is *how is Google Scholar even finding the extracted TXT files?"  They are not linked to off the main Item page.  So, that's the one thing that implies maybe it is indexing some other interface (like OAI-PMH/ORE)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;joaomelo&gt; i think that OAI  is currently exporting those TXT files</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; It could be getting them from the mets.xml files, that's what I always thought. I guess the question is -- does this happen in JSPUI as well? (my repos are all XMLUI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;joaomelo&gt; but only for a specific schema (XOAI schema)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In general though, I'm just trying to gather more information here... I'd be glad to reach out to Anurag again if needed.  The one issue here is that I don't have a production DSpace instance being indexed by Google Scholar, so I cannot answer any questions he may have about logs, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; just an idea - but remember that there's still the link to METS in the HTML comments. maybe Google just got that agressive about indexing. the OAI interface isn't really "hidden" from Google, either.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aschweer -- I think so far, all examples that have been found are XMLUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; which would then point away from OAI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; aschweer -- so, you could be right...maybe it's somehow indexing the mets.xml</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; as helix84 said, the link is there -- so if they really want to, they can get the links from there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hmm...yea, I forgot that METS link is in a comment</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I definitely see Googlebot accessing lots and lots of .pdf.txt files. Of course it isn't helpful enough to give a referer...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (i.e. there were 2 separate threads on dspace-tech describing this issue)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; might be 2 separate issues, though. not sure yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; could be separate issues, but they are eerily similar that they sound related to me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (which is why I wanted to get a sense of what others may have seen in Google Scholar)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; let me ask again - is the issue whether TXT are accessible or just whether Google Scholar should give priority to the PDFs? Because I'd answer the first question no, it's how we designed it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; hmm... found a link to a /statistics page... which mentions pdf.txt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I'd say it's the priority thing but I'm tempted to just make all my TEXT bundles private, I see no reason for them to be open</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- we could make the TXT inaccessible..that's an option.  But, the root issue here is that Google Scholar seems to be ignoring the "easy to find PDF"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ok, i just wanted to clear that up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I see no external access to mets.txt files in the last 3 weeks or so, even though there was Googlebot activity in that time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; gah and maybe if I look for mets.xml it'd be more useful...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; is it ignoring it, or honoring its understanding of what a 301 redirect means?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we could just "fix" this by making the extracted TXT inaccessible to anonymous.  I'm not really certain why it would ever need to be accessible publicly anyways..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- that's a good question actually</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; maybe 302/found would be better?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it is worth noting that the 301 Redirect that PeterDietz noted is a *default setting* in the XMLUI only...it's there because the bitstream URL structure of XMLUI is *different* from the JSPUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; No external access to mets.xml in the last 4 weeks either. My customised stats don't expose .pdf.txt links, so I'm still curious how Google Scholar even finds them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In case people don't understand my statement about that 301 Redirect...

<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if the 301 Redirect is part of the problem, we can fix it in the DSpace codebase....either by changing it so it's not a 301 Redirect, or seeing if we can get the XMLUI to display the actual final URL in the &lt;meta&gt; tags that Google Scholar uses, *instead of* putting the 301 Redirect URL there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; The fact remains that this would be a problem for a lot of dspace installations and it's in the interest of Google to provide links to PDFs, not TXTs. So we should probably let them know about that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger...yea, this is a bit of Cocoon magic...but, the comment describes what it is doing..it's taking aURL of the structure  "/bitstream/[handlePrefix]/[handlePostfix]/[sequence]/[name]" (JSPUI URL) and redirecting it to "/bitstream/handle/[handlePrefix]/[handlePostfix]/[name]?sequence=[sequence]" (which is the XMLUI URL structure)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; what i'm saying is even if changing 301 to 302 would fix this, there still will be a lot of time until the fix is deployed on all the affected installations</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; GoogleMetadata constructs the citation_pdf_url piecemeal anyway, so it shouldn't be a problem to change that to the ?sequence format</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; (but I guess that'd break compatibility with JSPUI)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 -- yea, I agree we should let Google Scholar know about it... I'm just trying to first determine the extent of this issue, so we can describe it better to Google Scholar</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; permanent="yes" = 301</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; Hm, I see bingbot and Baiduspider crawling .pdf.txt as well. I'd really like to know where they get the links for those.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; huh..interesting, aschweer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; can you grep your logs and see what that same bot IP address indexed just *before* the .pdf.txt?  I know that's not always the referrer (some bots jump around a bit), but it might help</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In general here, it sounds like we've hit upon some various "rough theories" but nothing beyond that.  I'd suggest maybe we all just keep an eye out for more Google Scholar oddities (and report any you find to dspace-tech) in our own servers.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I can also send off an email to Anurag @ Google Scholar to let him know that we've now had several reports of these issues.  If any of you have examples from your own DSpace instance, please send them along as well.  It'd be good to give Google Scholar lots of examples of the issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; for 3.0, do we drop permanent="yes"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: i wouldn't hurry with that, we don't even know if that would help with anything</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger -- to be clear, if we remove "permanent='yes'" from those redirects, does that turn it into a 302 redirect?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I mean, clearly the crawlers are re-crawling anyway, so the benefit of the 301 isn't working out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, I'd need to test it, just wanted to get a read on whether it was worth it to try</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it could be worth trying I guess.  I'm hesitant to also implement it immediately though, as we still haven't determined if that's really the issue at hand</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; From bingbot, I see several that jump straight to one particular .pdf.txt, but usually after it's seen the item page first. It does go both to the ?sequence and the other link version for the .pdf.txt link, with 24+ hours in between</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think the next steps are just to find as many examples as we can...and then start to try and narrow down the issue as best we can</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I'm happy to share examples from my logs -- just to be honest, I'm not even sure exactly what would make a good example</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; As I said, I can also email Anurag about this oddity... Maybe we should start up a JIRA ticket to capture all this stuff together in one place?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; it would be helpful in discussions if we had a Jira ticket...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; jinx</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think a "good example" is any item you notice that Google Scholar is linking to the ".pdf.txt" instead of the ".pdf"...for example, Reinhard noted that there are 3 such examples on the first page of results from this Google Scholar search: <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=shieber+violently+broccoli&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C22&amp;as_sdtp=">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=shieber+violently+broccoli&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C22&amp;as_sdtp=</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; In those search results, scan for the items that have a link to "[TXT] from [url]"  -- those are all DSpace sites...and I've checked...all are running XMLUI</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; tdonohue: ok, I'll dig some up. Do you think some apache log snippets for bot activity on these items would help too?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; it could..not sure, aschweer, to be honest.  If you can actually determine what the bot looks to be doing, it may be very helpful.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I've got to run now, but I'll do some digging around in the Scholar search results and the logs later today</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm gonna close up this meeting now -- I feel like we don't have much more to discuss.  But, I'll go start up a ticket for this &amp; encourage everyone to add whatever you find</span><br />
