<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I thought we discussed it last week?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; But, the status of this particular PR is that RichardJones needs support in "cleaning it up".  Basically, we need someone who is more "git savvy" to help Richard out, as the current PR accidentally reverts many changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- nope, not in the "official meeting" (I just checked).  A small group discussed it in the "JIRA Backlog review"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK, brain fade.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-green">* l_a_p (~chatzilla@host195-221-dynamic.55-79-r.retail.telecomitalia.it) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I just wanted it to be more "broadly" known (and logged), that we need some extra help on PR#229.  Anyone with some extra time &amp; some "git-fu" is welcome</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I think Peter Dietz is working with Richard Jones, but I could be wrong</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I don't know there's much more we can talk about regarding #229 though...so, I'm gonna move on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and kompewter should be pinging Peter right about now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger... I've heard 'rumors' of that, but no actual proof.  I think everyone suspects that PeterDietz may be...put, it'd be nice to know for sure :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Just really don't want #229 to slip through the cracks...it's got a lot of fixes we need to get into 4.0)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok...moving along to #230: <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/230">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/230</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Fix for Metadata Schema lookup by long namespace and not short name. by awaterma · Pull Request #230 · DSpace/DSpace · GitHub ] - <a href="https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/230">https://github.com/DSpace/DSpace/pull/230</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; This one needs some more debugging.  We don't know what the method is receiving that isn't working, or where it comes from.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh yea.  awaterma has been in #dspace in recent days.  mhwood &amp; I both chatted with him, and asked for some more examples of the error he's seeing (I'm still not sure I understand the problem)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I agree with Richard, this change is not necessary. We shouldn't have any metadata in the registry that is not bind to a schema</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; awaterma said he's gonna get us some more info &amp; hopefully better examples of how to reproduce the issue he sees</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I think we're "waiting on more info" with #230.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; Hi</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; "offbeat", or "insane" but in a funny way.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, if I've got this right... this PR creates a new "Webapp" table in the database, where any running DSpace webapp then "registers itself".  This then allows the "dspace version" commandline script to report which webapps are running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes.  I didn't like doing it that way, but we had no other place visible to all running pieces of DSpace that didn't require at least as much cleanup.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hi, awaterma_: sorry, I had moved along to the next Pull Request.  You can read our IRC logs up at <a href="http://irclogs.duraspace.org/index.php?date=2013-08-28">http://irclogs.duraspace.org/index.php?date=2013-08-28</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ IRC Log for #duraspace on irc.freenode.net, collected by DuraLogBot ] - <a href="http://irclogs.duraspace.org/index.php?date=2013-08-28">http://irclogs.duraspace.org/index.php?date=2013-08-28</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; Will do</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: yes. the reason for doing it so is that one webapp listing other webapps is hard without it having some elevated privileges and elevating privileges just for this is probably a bad idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: the DB table approach is not without its issues, either - a crashed webapp would be visible as running.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood &amp; helix84: yea, I wasn't saying it's a "bad" way to "register" the running webapps...just was making sure I understood how it was working. :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; Yes, I still haven't had time to put together some more information for you guys. I'm leaving for new work in the US and have been tasked with rebuilding our DSpace server for production.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; RE: #232 the only "other" way I could think of would be to write some basic "lock" file to filesystem (which signifies a particular webapp has started up)...but, I don't know that's any different/better than the DB version here.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; why not read url informations from the dspace.cfg and make a ping ?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, that was my thinking.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: it's the exact same thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: that works for the *primary* webapp, but it may not help you find Solr/OAI-PMH/SWORD/etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the only webapp that is not visible in the dspace.cfg is the jspui or xmlui when the other is used as primary</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; Basically, the issue is that when I submit metadata that is not in the main DC schema, the data does not show up. I had to use a debugger to step through source to determine that getSchemaID was returning a blind DC schema id. Hence the pull request.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; solr and sword have properties in dspace.cfg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; oai-pmh should have one so that we can link the interface in the home page for example</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; (sorry about the out of context messages)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger wonders if DSpace is the wrong application to ask about what's running in a particular container?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: yes, hence the "register itself" approach</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Perhaps all of the app.s *should* have configured paths, but I don't see one for PMH.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini: good point.  Solr &amp; SWORD do have URLs in configs... "solr.server" and "servicedocument.url" (for SWORD).  If we added one also for OAI-PMH, we might be able to get away with a "ping"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; solr config variables can point to other hosts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The other side of that coin is that we wouldn't need to configure these paths in dspace.cfg if each app. works out where it is and supplies that in the table.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; Hey could you guys ping me when you have time to discuss my PR? I'm working on an init script for another project at the moment. If you prefix a comment with my name, I'll get an alert.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; s/config/url/</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; helix84 meant to say: solr url variables can point to other hosts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; report an oai-pmh base url in metatag could be useful also for project like oaister, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; awaterma_ sure...not sure when we'll get back to it. I think we mostly just still need a good example how to replicate, and I'm not sure if we'll have a chance to talk through that in today's meeting</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; awaterma_: IMHO it's OK to discuss this asynchronously</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: but this is what this issue is about - you need A because you need A :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; bollini:  yes, *if* there is a well-known place to put such information so that consumers know what to look for.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; well we are the developers of the major repository platform so we can make the standard :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; awaterma_ : as I mentioned earlier today, I just don't have any idea how to replicate the issue you are seeing with #230, so at least I'd want more of a step-by-step process of how to replicate the problem and an example error message, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; [ah okay, I'll try and setup a vanilla install and replicate the error. I'm pretty sure it's reproducible with my tests for our Guzzle client for SwordV2 [<a href="https://github.com/ecosur-infonomia/sword2-client/tree/master/test]">https://github.com/ecosur-infonomia/sword2-client/tree/master/test]</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, with #232... would a "ping" be a "good enough" solution, going against various URLs as configured in your dspace.cfg?   In a way, I kinda like that, as it also checks that you've properly set the URLs in your dspace.cfg (which can be a common issue) ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm thinking that there ought to be a way to ask the container what apps are running, and then present that information in a machine-readable fashion.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; bollini:  I agree that *if* we had declared paths in dspace.cfg then pinging them would serve, and there would be nothing to clean up.  OTOH now we have the possibility that dspace.cfg declares something that is not true, if the app.s are actually installed at other context paths.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Though, I'm not against this DB solution either... what mhwood has done is actually quite cool</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: no, the Solr urls are not meant for that purpose</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: why not?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; mhwood: if the path on the dspace.cfg are wrong the other webapp don't run properly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; what if the oai solr URL points to <a href="http://example.com/solr/oai?">http://example.com/solr/oai?</a> what does it tell you about the oai webapp?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: solr provide a ping method</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: OAI solr can run fine and it's still possible OAI is not running or is not working</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: oai need a specific settings we should promove the use of a new property in the dspace.cfg to disseminate this information</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Notice that the code does ping the URL stored in the table, and removes dead registrations.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 : right, that's why we need a separate OAI-PMH config (to ping whether OAI is actually running).  But, pinging individual Solr instances is still useful to tell if Solr is also running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; what if I make a default installation of all the webapps and next I remove something? all the webapps will be registred but not running</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: no, the OAI url is not configured in dspace configuration, it's configured in servlet container configuration</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; helix84: yes, I know. But I want to add this information in the dspace.cfg</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: so it will be in two places?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; also the dspace.url is known to the container</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Actually I wonder if we could remove some of the config. that we have, and probe it out of the container.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: IMHO configuring the same value in two places is just asking for trouble. The "register itself" solution is cleaner because a webapp knows in which context it's running.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; tdonahue: Thanks for taking a look. I should have something put together tomorrow around this plan. The underlying issue is in "getMetaDataField" in Item which has a schemaId check and precludes inclusion of parsed metadata if it can't be looked up by means of the find method (during Update in Item). <a href="https://github.com/awaterma/DSpace/blob/dbce3eb21b963c8ab94f687abef2c012d161e48f/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/content/Item.java#L1819">https://github.com/awaterma/DSpace/blob/dbce3eb21b963c8ab94f687abef2c012d161e48f/dspace-api/src/main/java/org/dspace/content/Item.java#L1819</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; tdonahue: So we lose valuable data, due to the inability to match a schemaId to an existing schema, that fails during the find lookup. Hence the secondary lookup based on Namespace.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: what do you mean? it can't say a) whether the webapp is running b) which URL it's running on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helxi84: I fully understand that SOLR URLs are different from webapp URLs.  But, both are important to know whether both are running.   I realize there's a SOLR-OAI URL and a OAI-PMH URL, just like there's a SOLR Stats URL and an XMLUI URL.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: e.g. if your OAI-PMH URL is failing...it'd be a huge red flag if your SOLR OAI URL is also failing..  Similarly if you are complaining that Stats aren't displaying in the XMLUI, it'd be nice to know if you SOLR Stats URL is configured properly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; tdonahue: yeah, when the schema ids don't match, which is what I was getting. Hence, a backup lookup by namespace was the route I tried out. It might be just cleaner to return only valid schema IDs and throw some type of exception when the schema can't be found, that would expose any underlying issue my namespace lookup might hide. Although, from my point of view, the idea is just to get a handle to the schema by any means possible, in or</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, I agree it's good to know whether all 3 solr URLs has a solr running (and I don't see a problem with finding out). it's just not relevant to this issue (where and whether webapps are running).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; awaterma_: Richard seems to be saying that your solution shouldn't work, that something elsewhere is asking the wrong question.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Possibly as part of a separate issue I (or someone) should factor "webapps running" out for multiple callers.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: I actually don't agree that Solr is "not relevant to this issue".  Solr itself *is* a webapp (and responds as such). It's completely relevant if we are trying to determine which webapps are running in your DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; tdonahue: could you let me know why returning the DC_Schema_Id is preferable to throwing an exception or doing a backup lookup (and then throwing an exception if not found)?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; awaterma_ : I'm actually not the best person to ask.  I need to look closer at the code in that area (It's been a long long time since I have).  RichardRodgers actually has worked with DSpace longer than I have, so I trust his opinion here. It might be best to bring some of this discussion back to your PR, maybe?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I'd say that blindly returning DC_Schema_Id is wrong.  But why does the second lookup succeed?  Apparently the method should not be receiving namespace URIs.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the default to dc_schema_id was introduced for backward compatibility when in dspace there was not schema concept</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; ah, a bug fix! :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, should 232 wait, for now?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I suspect we may need to bring these discussions back to their respective PRs / JIRA tickets for now... I'm not sure of a better option.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so, did anyone suggest a better approach to finding out webapp URL and whether it's running?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood: I suspect yes, 232 might need to wait.  I feel like we all need to think on this more and bring it back up in a future meeting.  Not sure we have common ideas on this yet?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OK.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;awaterma_&gt; Very good, I'm moving back to my upstart script for Node. :) You guys take care, I'll add the discussion to my PR so it's captured.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: yes, the other approach suggested was the "ping each URL based on it's configuration setting". But, that spun us off into arguments ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; thanks awaterma_.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ..... we don't have those URLs :(</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I suspect we have two options:  (1) Do a very simple ping of URLs based on their configuration (in dspace.cfg and the like),  OR (2) do #232 database option</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84...I think you are missing the point.. we DO have most of those URLs that we need to ping.  They are in config files</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ok - use case</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: there's only one (or possibly two) URLs that are NOT obtainable from a config file</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and those we could add)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; one reason we wanted to find out the webapp URL is to be able to display an OAI URL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; where do you get it from in configuration?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; for the record, I'm not opposed to the approach that 232 takes, if it scratches an itch that needs scratching, it seems fine to me... I have a hunch this information is already available, but using a DB is OK, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: right.  the OAI URL is one of the few that are MISSING from the configuration.  We had a suggestion (from bollini) to add a new config for the OAI URL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: but, you can obtain the primary URL (XMLUI or JSPUI), SWORD URL, SWORD2 URL, and most SOLR URLs from configuration files.  OAI-PMH is the only one missing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; this is completely upside down</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; servlet container's configuration is the place which actually authoritatively says this webapp lives onthis URL</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; like I said... we obviously have two differing opinions being presented here.. which is why I suspect we need to think on this more</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Indeed, the container knows, while the config is only guessing.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; that we happen to duplicate this information in dspace.cfg for one (or several) webapps is ... accidental design</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I agree: "The container knows, while the config is only guessing", but since DSpace uses the *config* setting...something is likely to break anyways if your config setting is wrong.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; batch script need this information too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; and if the goal of this "dspace version" is to help find areas where things "broke", then knowing whether the *config* setting is wrong is beneficial!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: the direction we should be thinking is opposite - remove dspace.url from dspace.cfg and find it out in runtime from the webapp</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: good point</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; OTOH the batch script could fish it out of the database....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; but the webapp need to be started before the batch script can guess</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 : I'm perfectly fine with working towards that approach..but, that's a different discussion (it's unrelated to #232).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; note that I'm not against found a smart way to autoconfigure the system (ask to the container the url) but IMHO this is a task much harder than how it looks</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; most of our tomcat are setup to a localhost as virtual host</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, it is a larger discussion. would it be better to have a separate ticket / a wiki page / a separate DevMtg for it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; the real host is in apache via modjk</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bollini &amp; I are in agreement here.  I'm NOT arguing against autoconfiguring the system (I'd love to do that)... I was just pointing out that since we are not already doing it, a simple "ping" of URLs may be good enough for "dspace version"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; bollini:  we also run behind HTTPD (using mod_proxy_ajp).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: feel free to start up a discussion place...It is a worthwhile discussion, I just worry it is "clouding" our view of PR#232 (and the "dspace version" script usage)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, I just wanted to add the friendly reminder...since Google indexes our IRC logs pretty heavily :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I need to go, if there is nothing else for me right now?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think we're done with the meeting for today (as we've run out of time).  I'll be around for some time to chat...but no more "official topics"</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (mwood@mhw.ulib.iupui.edu) has left #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yes, DS-1641 is a often requested feature. I'd also love to see it happen (and might be able to chip in with testing, etc., as it also would be a benefit to DSpaceDirect)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; i just wanted to say that we would need the ajax-multiple-files-uploader-with-progressbar in multiple places:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I'm trying to find the time to contribute back also the submission step that enable lookup in bibliographic database shown in Canada</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; * batch imports, as mentioned in the jira issue</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; * submission process upload step</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; * edit item bitstream upload</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; all of the above for JSPUI and all XMLUI themes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; I will be not able to use the full set of features for the 4.0 contribution</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm available to help with batch import testing (1641), ajax-uploader, and bibliographic lookup bolini just mentioned</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bollini&gt; but the jquery-upload-file plugin has some very important features that we should implement: chucked upload, multiple file, directory drag&amp;drop</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I know that my boss would green-light any time I spend on those topics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bollini: the one thing I don't have working is chunked upload. I'm wondering if it's possible to use it for automatic retries (HTTP resume). From what I read it seems possible.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: yep, I agree.  Though I'd hope that there'd be some "commonality" amongst those various interfaces  (or at least we could work towards making them similar) :)  (Not necessarily saying the XMLUI &amp; JSPUI versions would be identical..but if we could make each of the three XMLUI ones similar and each of the three JSPUI ones similar, that'd still help)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I think that should be our primary goal because not sharing as much code as possible will make maintenance and upgrades of this feature a PITA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yep, agreed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: I like how the three of us just happened to work on the same problem using the same piece of software at the same time :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: I'm actually not "working on it", yet :)  I just looked into it yesterday (as it's been a high priority request also for DSpaceDirect customers), and stumbled across "jQuery-File-Upload", which is why I created Ds-1641...I was hoping maybe someone else would have time to dig in even more</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm not sure if I'll actually find time myself to do anything related to Ds-1641 before 4.0...but, I'd definitely be able to find a little time to help test something or review something...just not sure I'll have significant development time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I just finished the server-side support in Jython today. It's not DSpace specific, but my specialized use case will use it to upload bitstreams to DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; Helix84, I'm not averse to Jython, share? :-) Please. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I will make it a separate project and try to include it to upstream. Now I can send you the code with all the debug statements and comments.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sounds fine, I've borrowed plenty of code this way</span><br />
