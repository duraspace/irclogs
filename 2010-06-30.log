<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; May try and keep this brief today -- I'm sure we are all busy with OR10 preparations, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I fly to Madrid tomorrow, I'm a little nervous already</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; we'll be doing backpacking before the conference</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; BTW -- in case you haven't heard, Madrid Metro system is currently on strike -- could be interesting if it isn't resolved soon: <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gzuwL6lfIIVc3zUx023auW2OKy5A">http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gzuwL6lfIIVc3zUx023auW2OKy5A</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; really hoping that gets resolved very soon...</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, PeterDietz -- hopefully it won't affect your backpacking trip (which sounds like fun!)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I just have one announcement today, per GSoC</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- did you have any GSoC updates for today?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; go ahead :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; trying to come up with something witty about ears burning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, good anticipation there :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So I've organized a meeting on friday at 06:00 PST / 09</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; opse... sent that prematurely</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; 06:00 PST / 09:00 EST, i assume :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the meeting will have all GSoC students present to discuss projects</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; excellent!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; We will also have the students generating status updates for friday including overviews, comments, concerns they may have with the process</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I will consolidate this material for discussion on MOnday</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good -- is anyone allowed to sit in on the Friday meeting?  (and if so, will it be advertised on dspace-devel today/tomorrow?)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-green">* bojans (~Bojmen@91.118.62.158) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Yes, certainly, I want to send out a formal announcement today now that we have an agreed time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds great</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; other are welcome... contributions to the agenda and volunteerism are very needed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'll try and make it for most/all of the meeting -- I hope everyone else here can as well...(even if you need to just lurk for most of it)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok -- the only other item I had on the agenda was OR10.  Any questions/comments/suggestions before we all head off to Madrid?   Any suggested changes to our agenda for Monday?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Monday committer mtg agenda: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2010-07-05+-+OR10+Meeting">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DevMtg+2010-07-05+-+OR10+Meeting</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; Need to get a wiki page started for the students meetings ...

<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- good idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* cccharles (~user@131.104.62.47) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok -- any other topics to discuss today (everyone's quiet!  though, understandable that everyone is busy this week.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; There was some discussion on one of the MLs about bringing the minimum recommended PostgreSQL up into the 8.x range.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mhwood -- thanks for following up.  I think that makes sense, we just should probably run it through normal JIRA process, and determine what the absolute minimum should be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I had to do an extra dspace-upgrade step because of old postgres naming constraints going bad</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; but, I agree we should update that minimum -- likely for 1.7 (which seems like it will be the next release)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we should actually check all of our minimums -- would be good to update Java to 1.6 (as I think 1.5 is now at end-of-life?, if I recall correctly)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Maintainer support ends for 7.4 and 8.0 with their next bugfix or security release.  Support ends for 8.1 in November.  So 8.2 sounds like minimum.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt;   <a href="http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Release_Support_Policy">http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_Release_Support_Policy</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, so maybe we just need a JIRA issue to capture this, and then get it updated for DSpace 1.6</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Will do.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Java 5.0/1.5 is also past 'end of life' <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/index.jsp</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; oh, i meant Dspace 1.7 -- not 1.6, obviously</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; anything else to bring up today?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok -- i'll take that as a 'no'.  :) I'd like to go ahead and just close the meeting early today, as I don't have anything else to discuss, and have plenty to do before the end of the week!</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I look forward to seeing most of you in Spain!   For those who won't make OR10, we'll send off a summary of Monday's meeting (I'm hoping to find a note-taker).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Oh, and if you cannot make OR10 -- if you wanted, we could try and Skype you into the discussions -- but obviously if you are in the USA, that'd be a rather early meeting.  Let me know though if you want to try and Skype in)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Looking forward to the summary, unfortunately.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea -- mhwood -- sorry we'll miss you.  If you wanted to try and skype into some of the discussions, let us know.  We could setup a laptop so you could hear/see most of what's going on</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Still trying to get Skype to work.  Think I need a better microphone.  Thanks anyway.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok -- no problem, just thought I'd offer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok all -- that's it!  I'll be lurking for a while if anything else comes up.  But, consider the official meeting closed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hi all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; oops, too late ;P</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; i won't be at OR10 :( but to all those that are going: have fun, hopefully i can tune in on some webcasts or skype meetings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hi kshepherd -- sorry we'll miss you.  If you wanted us to try and Skype you into some of the discussions, that might be possible (or at least, I'm hopeful -- we're supposed to have internet there, and we'll have plenty of laptops)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; tdonohue: cool, perhaps if you email me a reminder a few hours before you begin any DSUG/committer meeting stuff, that'll let me get set up and test a skype call. if i don't respond, it probably means i'm not awake ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sure -- i'll try to remember -- though, I've got so much to do between now and then, I'm not sure I can be fully trusted :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; heh of course, don't worry too much about that ;) i'll be following various twitter feeds and so on, anyway</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea -- i'd say, if you decide you want to join via Skype, email one of us in Madrid and let us know -- we can always set you up "on the fly" on Monday</span><br />
