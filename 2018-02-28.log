<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, on to the "big topic" on this agenda for today...and it loops back to the DSpace Entities Working Group efforts/meetings</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; For those who have not been following along (in meetings, via meeting recordings or on entities-wg channel)...here's a brief summary:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; 1) We've had many many requests for DSpace to be able to manage more than "just" documents/research.  Primarily, the ongoing desire from lots of folks to store info about authors (ORCIDs, Researcher Pages, etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; 2) Out of that, and lots of CRIS (Current Research Info Systems) out of Europe (see also DSpace-CRIS project), the DSpace Steering Group wanted to dig into options to enhance the DSpace data model to support new types of "entities" (like authors). Hence, the Entities WG was established</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; 3) The Entities WG has been analyzing ways to achieve all this...namely looking at two approaches to getting their quickly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; 3a) A "top down" approach, which might involve looking at what DSpace-CRIS has built &amp; is used in production in Europe, and pulling in all or parts into core DSpace to support this.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; 3b) Or a "bottom up" approach, which might involve being inspired by DSpace-CRIS efforts, and _rebuilding_ a more simplistic version of it based on our existing data model</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; If you haven't seen much of DSpace-CRIS, more info is at <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACECRIS/DSpace-CRIS+Home">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACECRIS/DSpace-CRIS+Home</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; DSpace-CRIS is currently an "extension" of DSpace. It's a complete copy of the DSpace codebase + datamodel, with major data model enhancements (on the side, in separate tables, etc) to support new Entities -- Authors, Organizations, Projects, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;jcreel256&gt; we piloted some work here where we adapted the metadata authority values to hold URIs for contributor profile pages</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So...essentially...this has been a discussion going on for months, since late 2018.  And, I'm getting the feeling it's starting to get some major push towards a "quick decision" in the next month (maybe months?).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; There is an analysis that RCAAP (from Portugal), which is the team that has been coordinating these Entities WG meetings, has written here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb83KKLi9Q29OXF59WV5KYepcPPZWtSzpQftTDAjFnk/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb83KKLi9Q29OXF59WV5KYepcPPZWtSzpQftTDAjFnk/edit</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Their view is essentially that they prefer the "bottom up" (or build it ourselves) approach, for the reasons they lay out in that document (and yes, it gets into some of the core data modeling of DSpace-CRIS, so it's not an easy skim)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Thanks for the summary.  It sounds like 3A provides some very specific out of the box solutions that would be very applicable in Europe.  3B sounds like a more generic approach that is perhaps more consistent with the current data model but less out of the box.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, I'm wanting to find a way to get more opinions / eyes into this.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; (As I'm not completely sold on this "re-build it ourselves" direction...considering DSpace-CRIS exists, and is a production quality system used by many institutions in Europe)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, my opinions aside, I'm basically looking for more ways to gather feedback / how to get others up-to-speed enough here to provide more feedback</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; I would like to hear from 4Science about why it was done that way.  The people we needed to ask were unable to attend.  That JDYNAwhateveritis table gives me the creeps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; One thing I will note is that some of these entities are just roles.  A submitter, a subscriber, and an author might all be the same person.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I presume an attractive benefit of 3A is that it has the potential to attract greater adoption from folks looking for that out of the box experience.  I am unclear how adaptable the 3A approach is to other generic problems.  We use DSpace for digital collections and often have need to describe an "entity".  We often accomplish this by replicating the same metadata to multiple items that are retrieved by a</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Ditto project manager, team member, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @mwood: you are talking about the JDYNA_VALUES table which has a lot of `null` values.  While I haven't heard from @bollini directly, Claudio from 4Science noted that it is a non-normalized table cause that provided better performance (in their testing). See this comment in that analysis doc: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb83KKLi9Q29OXF59WV5KYepcPPZWtSzpQftTDAjFnk/edit?disco=AAAABoOk5k0">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bb83KKLi9Q29OXF59WV5KYepcPPZWtSzpQftTDAjFnk/edit?disco=AAAABoOk5k0</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: but DSpace-CRIS also has a "dynamic entity object", which is a create-your-own-entity, essentially</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I am glad to know that is included</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I feel like we are treading water with all the 6.3 changes and the 7.0 work, so it is difficult to also feel urgency around the entity proposal.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; You probably don't want to hear this, but thinking about this and other issues is making me think that the relational model is not optimal for DSpace.  Something like a graph model might be more suitable.  But that work would be out-of-scope.  (I think I stumbled on an attempt to put a graph database under DSpace some years ago.  Lost the pointer, sorry.)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; There are a few other things that DSpace-CRIS has that DSpace doesn't, just to get a complete picture here:</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; * Full ORCID support (login via ORCID, claim your ORCID profile, send data to/from ORCID via your DSpace-CRIS profile)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; (Look at the right side)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; A lot of these things could come back into DSpace at some point.  But, it does beg the question still of...do we try and "rebuild this"?... do we think about trying to adopt what they have (to some extent) and enhance it?  And even, Is this a general direction that folks want to see out of DSpace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Do we have a list of entity types that we want to support?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @mwood: the basics (that I've heard requested) would be Authors (i.e. Researcher Pages) and Organizations (Organizational Units).  Both of which are in DSpace-CRIS.  But, obviously DSpace-CRIS has much more than that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; some things that people really want (i think!) like tighter ORCID integration require at least 'people' entities to work properly</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Yes, @kshepherd is correct...for us to fully support ORCID, we'd *need* People/Authors/Researcher Pages.  That's the reason our ORCID integration is currently very limited</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I could imagine making use of several of the features that you have mentioned (ORCID, Signpost, etc).  If the integration of DSpace-CRIS will lead to more adoption (and more contributors) then it sounds like there are some useful additions of functionality.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; brb</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm realizing the time is short-ish here. I'm also honestly curious from those here...how can I better inform you of this?  How can you get to a place where you feel you could provide feedback into this effort?  I'd like to hear more voices here, as this is potentially an important step/change in what DSpace "is"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; (And defining what DSpace "is" is not just a role for Steering...it's also a roll for Committers, DCAT, etc etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Could the 2 approaches that you describe be presented to a forum of DSpace tech folks to ask questions and understand the implications?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; It would be great to hear the arguments for/against each approach.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I imagine that a similar meeting might be desired for the DCAT folks, but I think the conversation would be different.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: yes, I think we could do that. Some of those arguments are in the Google Doc I linked to.  The "against going with DSpace-CRIS" is basically that the DSpace-CRIS data model is perceived as a bit "odd" in places, and possibly "too complex".  The "for going with DSpace-CRIS" is basically that the system has what we need (and more), and is in production in many European institutions.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Those are very basic arguments though ;)  But, we could talk through that in more detail either way</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; We *could* adopt bits of DSpace-CRIS now and rework the guts later if we really hate how something works.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; I get that from skimming the document, but I feel like I could be convinced of either approach with some conversation.  I also feel like we are so busy in the current work that none if this is likely to happen for 2-3 years.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Entities isn't going to be deliverable until DSpace 8 at the earliest, I think.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @mwood: i've had those same thoughts...it's basically "which end do you start at"... do we start complex (DSpace-CRIS) and look to simplify / clean up what needs it.  Or do we start with what we have (DSpace) and look to enhance it / make it more complex to support this.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; Another "wrench" here, per timelines...is there are some institutions that have told me (in private as of yet, nothing public quite yet), that they have dev resources to help make this happen "more quickly", but only if we are willing to also do so</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I.e. If we all come together and decide "yes we want this"...the resources *might* just figure themselves out to make this possible in a much shorter span of time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, that's a lot of "ifs" there still</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; Is their offer for DSpace 7 or 8?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; One thing that came out during the meeting is that a chunk of the DSpace-CRIS complexity is to deal with GUIfied configuration of the GUI, which would probably require major rework for DSpace 7 and is out-of-scope for Entities.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; DSpace 7, potentially</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, the reason I'm bringing this all up as a big deal is I'm essentially being told... we can possibly help you speed up DSpace 7, if you can provide this as part of DSpace 7.  Whether this idea will "pan out", I'm not sure...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; and we still haven't actually decided on a *direction* here...so, it's hard to resource an "idea"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;kshepherd&gt; re: ways to inform / get involved, i'd be keen on some big old mailing list discussions with references to web resources/pages, that works pretty well for me i think</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;terrywbrady&gt; It sounds like a decision needs to be made based on private information.  If the potential/promise is really significant, I imagine the technical community could suggest a preferred approach between the 2.  But, it feels like a significant increase in scope for DSpace 7.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; It is an increase in scope for DSpace 7, but if there are enough hands to form a second team, then it's not an increase in scope for New UI.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Actually, third:  New UI, REST, Entities.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @terrywbrady: not exactly.  The information is only "private" cause it literally came my way on Friday.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around (a) Is this even doable (drastic increase in scope is correct), and (b) could we make this happen "easier" (if we look to DSpace-CRIS for some/much of the underlying modeling/code).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; This will all be discussed with Steering too in an upcoming meeting...I'm just trying to get this to you all *immediately*, and that unfortunately means discussions are a bit "in progress"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;mwood&gt; Thank you.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; @kshepherd: that sounds very doable to bring this to an email thread on dspace-devel. Good idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; I can always pull from the notes here, draft that up, and kickstart it.  Hopefullly you all will help me keep that moving, add in questions/feedback , etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; So, thanks for the discussion here. I'm realizing we are over time.  But, I think I got a basic direction for moving this forward (on email list).  We can also then decide if we want to schedule a Zoom meeting (or multiple for separate time zones) to actually talk through</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; But, I'll leave the final decision on Zoom meetings to that email thread...we can see if that's what you all (and others) actually want...or if this is doable via email</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;DSpaceSlackBot&gt; &lt;tdonohue&gt; That wraps up the meeting for today!  I'm going to take a break, but will be back shortly...and will try and get a discussion thread started either later today or tomorrow morning (for me)</span><br />
