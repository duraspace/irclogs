<span class="irc-date">[20:11]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Going to start taking notes here on discussion, which has already started...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Discussion starting about Github code management (sharing code for each institution via github &amp; pullin in each others code). Graham suggests having a clear "release project/tag" for institutions to fork more easily</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Peter wants to generally share OSU code via GitHub &amp; encourage others to fork &amp; pull code from each other, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Maybe an area we need some "best practices" about how to fork DSpace from GitHub, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Questions: How do you develop a new feature locally (for your institution) and then pull it back into central DSpace (for a future release)?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Andrea - forked DSpace Github for 1.7.2 for their local code for customizations.  Thinks you should be able to potentially "rebase" onto 1.8.x (to attempt to reapply your local changes to 1.8)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (~mhwood@mhw.ulib.iupui.edu) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Peter - to keep GitHub history cleaner -- put source code changes in your DSpace fork.  But, config changes put in a separate "config repository" (so that you aren't committing/sharing your DB password, etc)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Andrea -- can also separate out projects via Maven, rather than putting all in DSpace source tree.  Just use Maven dependencies to link together.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; <a href="https://github.com/aschweer">https://github.com/aschweer</a> has a couple examples for small extra maven projects that could be used as a dependency</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; <a href="https://github.com/kshepherd/Curation">https://github.com/kshepherd/Curation</a> has my "curation stuff as maven proj"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; same idea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; yup kshepherd I got that idea from you</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Peter -- another topic to cover: Common/ThirdParty Business Logic API.   But, obviously not always as high a priority at individual institutions (as it may not always be in their existing needs)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Several feel Business Logic API is not of immediate need at institutions, but they would likely use it if it was there.   But, as Andrea mentions, we really may want some use cases before building a Business Logic API (to help in design)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Peter: Has anyone used REST API?  Especially in Production?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; None it seems.   Followup: Anyone interested in using a REST API in general, esp if more reliable?  Is it a matter of no one wanting to be the "guinea pig" / early adopter?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Peter: Maybe we need to create some sample "embed code" (Javascript) to show off how to embed DSpace content into your website.  Could put this up onto demo.dspace.org</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; This embed code could use the REST API, and would allow for a sample use case, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; just a quick comment re: "REST API" -- when thinking of use cases, it's also good to consider the RESTful APIs we already make available: SWORDv2 for deposit/workspace/retrieval/endpoint resolution/etc stuff, Solr for search/browse/retrieve, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/DSpace+ClientUI+built+on+RESTful+API+-+GSoC+2011">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/GSOC/DSpace+ClientUI+built+on+RESTful+API+-+GSoC+2011</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; so my thinking about REST API tends to be around admin functions that aren't already covered by sword, solr, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (though it would be great to have the full suite of functionality)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; MarkW : REST API should just expose what DSpace holds/does.  Things like config submission are on the client side</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; REST API may just have a very 'thin' layer over SWORD (for deposit) and over Solr (for search/browse).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; REST API should not invent new 'conventions' for deposit, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Users could choose to write apps directly against SWORD/SWORDv2 or Solr.  Or they could use the DSpace REST API, which just is a thin wrapper over these interfaces.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Question: Do I need to create a SWORD package beforehand (and how do I do this)?     Answer: SWORD is content agnostic.  With v2 you can actually pass multiple files (doesn't need to be a single ZIP or similar).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; kshepherd: can you share that right-click SWORD client?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Kim : In theory we probably should be embedding a header that has a link to the SWORD interface for DSpace.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; <a href="http://swordapp.org/2011/09/right-click-deposit-project/">http://swordapp.org/2011/09/right-click-deposit-project/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ty Peter</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hpottinger: sure, i'm just documenting and screencasting some demos for it right now, but you can download a Win7 installer from my github as of right now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; REST API should just use SWORD directly.  It shouldn't reinvent anything, and packaging should be left up to client side</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; kshepherd: screencasts and demos would be helpful, too, if you can share those</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; REST API could be used initially more as a 'read only' API?  Provide something like content reports, statistics, etc.?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Kim - Skylight actually just goes directly against Solr (which is RESTful itself)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; As we are talking REST, and handing off to the underlying search engine, this is an interesting read: <a href="http://engineering.socialcast.com/2011/05/realtime-search-solr-vs-elasticsearch/">http://engineering.socialcast.com/2011/05/realtime-search-solr-vs-elasticsearch/</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; DS-552</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oops, no kompewter.  <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-552">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-552</a>  "Servlet to deliver repository size statistics"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, discovery/solr will be "out of the box" for DSpace?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Kim -- should look at what Fedora has done with their mature REST API.  It is used in conjunction with RSearch (or whatever).  Perform search with one, and then call REST API with the discovered ID.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Kim -- is 'RESTful' DSpace really just SWORD + Solr/Elastic Search + Admin REST API + whatever other RESTFul interfaces needed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Is it too complex to have that many RESTful interfaces</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; my 2 cents to is not make DSpaceREST too complex. HAve all your sword client talk directly to dspace-sword, not to the rest-api sword wrapper.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (Mark W pointed out the benefit of central authZ if we wrap all the RESTful stuff under one service)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I can do webcam, if need be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs&gt; Not really - if you want to have all of that functionality exposed RESTful-y, then you have the same number of endpoints, regardless of what application / standard it falls under</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; grahamtriggs++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; ahh kompewter never booted because we changed offices this week. And I don't have the kompewter bot set to auto-start</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; but the authZ point Mark made has got me thinking a bit more..</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* tdonohue call has officially ended, but if there's more discussion/thoughts that come up RE: REST API, etc., I'll still be lurking around for a while.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Let me guess:  expose authZ RESTfully and rig e.g. Solr to query it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; heh, well, that still involves 'rigging' solr, which is just as bad as rigging solr to talk to dspace-api for authZ</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ow, Authz via Solr, makes my face hurt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; kshepherd: does skylight do anything currently with DSpace stats views?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; no, not much point, since the collections/sets we expose via Skylight don't get "hits" in Dspace istelf</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; ah, yes... hrm...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; (DSpace and XML/JSP UI is for backend admin only in the scenario we're working towards)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and you're probably using something standard for statistics reporting, then, AWstats, Web Trends, that kind of thing</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hpottinger: would not be hard to do, if you wanted to, though... but as Peter D pointed out, there are some things like resolving constants (object type) and vars (collection ID) that make keeping context tricky</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; hpottinger: yeh pretty much, and GA for analytics/trends</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; here's what I was hoping to do: figure out a way to get individualized usage stats to contributors</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:33]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; heh, yeah, good luck ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; it's gonna happen, somehow, I really think it's part of the social contract of repositories</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; "but digitalcommons used to do it!" yeah, i'm used to hearing that one ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Didn't Rochester's Researcher Pages do something like that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; problem on our end of things is that we're a librarian-mediated deposit shop...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; yes, good point, i don't know whether they based 'contributor' on creator/contributor metadata, or on submitter ID though</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, first, we'd have to figure out *who* to send the reports to :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kshepherd&gt; we've got our research pubs management software integrated with dspace as its 'fulltext backend' repo, so we do actually have clear relationships between our researchers and pubs in DSpace</span><br />
