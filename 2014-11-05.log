<span class="irc-date">[15:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; A few quick notes before we get started...and robint just asked about one ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm heading on holiday (paternity leave) from Thurs, Nov 20 - Mon, Dec 8 (returning on that monday).  My plan is to be completely offline during that timeperiod</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, it's not a long holiday, but I'll keep reminding you as it gets closer (just a few weeks away now).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (and dates may change slightly, but that's the latest estimate)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; you'll be back in time to watch the new release roll out, but you'll miss testathon :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: good luck with your own release. 3.0, right?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; A few other notes:  With the ending of Daylight Savings, I've pushed the JIRA Backlog Hour for today to 16UTC (as 14UTC is 8:00am for me, and too hard to achieve these days).  So, for the time being, whenever there's a 15UTC meeting, JIRA Backlog will be *afterwards*</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: actually, 2.0... we have a 2 year old girl (almost 3), with another girl on the way</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; My +1 was for the time change, in case it's not clear. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; One final note before business: You probably have already noticed the banners on the Wiki &amp; JIRA. But, both systems will be unavailable from 9am-5pm EST on Saturday for system/server maintenance. I'll be posting this to all DSpace lists after this meeting as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I believe that's all the notes I have for today...but I'll let you know if I remember anything else ;)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, moving along now to 5.0 Topics.  I'm wondering if one of our RT fearless leaders (peterdietz or hpottinger) would like to update us on latest status, next steps, etc.?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; are our RT fearless leaders around? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I refuse to accept the label of leader, as it might get me fired :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I'm aware that we have a rescheduled Testathon starting next week (needs an announcement to go out today/tomorrow).  We need to get the demo site updated, an RC1 cut, some last bugs fixed prior to RC1...just don't have all the specifics myself</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well, we're waiting for the last new feature to be merged (DSPR#621) which Pascal and Mark are working on, even as we speak.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; helix84: I think we are close a solution. ;-)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; other than that, we're finding and fixing a lot of bugs.

<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; Is there any chance the SOLR version bump will still make it in RC1?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; or is this something we may address later, or reschedule for DSpace 6?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bram-atmire: good question. I'm not aware of anyone working on that....but maybe I'm not up-to-date?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bram-atmire: I've seen your comment, but do we need a Solr version bump? I'm not aware of anything in DSpace 5 that requires it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; bram-atmire, I actually tried bumping Solr up, as it looks like it might address our transitive dependeny issue with restlet, but it died in flames</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; on a related note, one of the big features in 5.0 is easy multi-version upgrade from virtually any previous release thanks to Flyway (DB migration). We'll also need migration for Solr data. I wrote up a proposal here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+5.0+Status#DSpaceRelease5.0Status-Solrupgrade(WIP)">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+5.0+Status#DSpaceRelease5.0Status-Solrupgrade(WIP)</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; other than that, a version bump will allow pdietz to also bump elasticsearch</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; and in general, performance is better and more features are available</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; Those are the reasons I know of, maybe others have other reasons as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; I had a look at the version bump earlier today and the furthest I can cleanly go is to 4.6.1</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; bram-atmire: sounds good. let's collaborate on a plan to also enable easy Solr migration from 1.6 to whatever we decide to upgrade to.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;bram-atmire&gt; “cleanly” meaning without massive rework?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; bram-atmire: I think we all agree a version bump would be *nice*. It's just a matter of timing at this point. We'd need someone to do the work to make it happen ASAP, and ensure that it's still stable.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; the later versions pull in a lot of jetty stuff through sloppy maven dependencies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; so the same exclusions would have to be applied</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Anyone want to take on the challenge of looking how far we can "easily" bump up Solr?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; would it work for Atmire if the RT gives you free reins in this?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; (missed this #duraspace window) yeah. As far as we can move to newer version the better. If its just extra dependencies, then maybe we can add the exclusions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; one remark. I would prefer *not* to bump lucene: this will probably break the lucene indices. as solr is a separate webapp we can have a higher lucene version in the solr webapp than in the dspace-api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; oh, speaking of free reins, I asked grahamtriggs if he wanted to "just fix" some of his findbugs bugs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; roeland_atmire++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; no reply from grahamtriggs yet</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; Doesn't bumping solr/ES kind of require lucene to bump as well?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: he did reply - that he won't have the time before the release, but he'll prepare some materials about how to use findbugs</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; probably too late in the release process to remove lucene index code</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; peterdietz: lucene jars are bundled in the solr war</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; the solr and lucene version need to be the same within the solr webapp but not in the dspace-api</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; aha, I see the note now, helix84, thanks for letting me know</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; roeland: doesn't using a newer lucene version in solr bump the lucene index to that version automatically?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; it could but shouldn’t</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; if it does it’s a bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; roeland: even if solr is writing stats?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; s/stats/access statistics</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; pbecker meant to say: roeland: even if solr is writing access statistics?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; pbecker: pom.xml has separate lucene.version and solr.version. We pull in the Solr war from Maven Central whole, with its own Lucene jars included.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; alright.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; pbecker: the statistics core is written to by the Solr webapp. DSpace Lucene doesn't access it directly, AFAIK.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; helix84++: that is precisely why we can have separate versions</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I was just wondering if lucene would make some kind of auto upgrade to an index. so if solr would write (using a newer lucene) some indexes....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I see.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; peterdietz: maybe Anja's statistics for REST did that, but that's not in 5.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;peterdietz&gt; ok, so someone may or may not bump the lucene/solr/ES versions in time for release.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, does @mire (roeland_atmire) plan to investigate bumping up Solr here in the next few days?  Or do we need to find a volunteer</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; first up we need a JIRA issue for the work</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 to a JIRA ticket</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; RT: let's confirm the deadlines first. Obviously the Solr bump would need to happen before rc1.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, with regards to Solr version bump, it sounds like we don't have anyone jumping forward to volunteer. There's still some time to make this happen, but it'd need to be ASAP and the RT would need to be aware of the work.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; i will upgrade it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so, is Atmire willing to do the work within the current deadlines?</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I thought to ask mhwood because it sounds like a fun little project, but he's working on EZID now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84 is talking about the fact that we need a clean path to upgrade Solr *Indexes* from older versions to latest version in DSpace 5.0.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; @roeland_atmire I don’t think the two issues are related</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (Just want to clarify that this is slightly *different*. It's about making sure older Solr indexes work with the latest version of Solr)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; or, get *updated* to work with the latest version of Solr</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; roeland_atmire: They aren't. We just need both before rc1.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: with regards to older Solr indexes, there's two options...(1) we try to find a way to 'script it' (i.e. automate it), or (2) we document clearly the steps involved to upgrade your Solr index if you are going from DSpace 1.6/1.7/1.8 to DSpace 5</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; doesn't the optimize script do this "update"?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: "optimize" does the update, but newer versions of Solr cannot optimize really old indexes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: correct on both counts</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; hpottinger: see helix84's notes...the Solr indexes created in DSpace 1.6/1.7/1.8 CANNOT be optimized by the Solr in DSpace 5</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: to be honest, I am worried this will be complex / time consuming to automate.  I'm starting to lean towards just taking your notes and giving step-by-step documentation specific to DSpace 1.6/1.7/1.8</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; in newer versions of csv there is the data import handler that may extract it from the old type core and import it as new version</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; it would be nice to automate this sice DSpace 5 already automates DB upgrades so nicely</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: well, I can do it under 5 shell script lines...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:44]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; roeland_atmire: do you have a link to that?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:45]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: well, if you get a shell script that works (in time for RC1), then maybe we can quickly find someone to translate that to Java</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; roeland_atmire: right, but you would need to either have the old and new Solr both running at the same time or do the export beforehand, which adds additional manual steps anyway - in other workds, it doesn't improve the current options</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: understood. I think that a shell script is a good "proof of concept" solution. Once we have that, I hope we can find a way to recreate in Java (even if that step happens just post-RC1)</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, are we wrapped up with Solr discussions for now? It sounds like we have a few next steps.  (1) roeland_atmire is going to investigate bumping up our Solr version, (2) helix84 is going to investigate creating a shell script to auto-update old Solr indexes (and then we'll find someone to help translate to Java)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'd prefer to find someone now or decide to skipt it for RC1, I've had the steps documented on the wiki for a couple of days now. And I can write the script today.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Let's move along.  Two more major topics for today.  We have DS-2249, and we have to finalize our plans for Testathon.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; helix84: if you give me a shell script, I'll work to translate to Java. But, I'm NOT going to have time to do so prior to RC1.  So, I'd suggest we just work towards a shell script for RC1, and then Java later.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: agreed</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, DS-2249 next</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; first thanks again to roeland_atmire about bringing DS-2249 up. Just to give you a quick sum up: DSpace 4 requires tomcat 7 and java 1.7, DSpace 5 does as well (at least yet). but tomcat 7 uses by default java 1.6 to compile jsps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2249">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-2249</a> ] - [DS-2249] Tomcat 7 JSP compiler Jasper defaults to Java 6 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; so either we are going on to use java 1.6 for jsps and 1.7 for the rest of DSpace which can be confusing or we are looking for a solution.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; is there any fix for this from the Tomcat team?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; you can configure tomcat to use 1.7 for jsps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; that's easy but it has to be done *global* for all webapps run by this instance of tomcat.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and of course, it's an extra step for the dspace admin</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; there is even a way to configure it by servlet but that would require to add tomcat specific code to our web.xml which I don't like.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; why does it need to be done global, if only the JSPUI actually has JSPs to compile?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I haven't found a way I like yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; pbecker: do you know what happens when a different servlet container encounters the tomcat-specific elements in web.xml?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; it has to be done as init parameter for the jasper servlet which is the jsp engine in tomcat.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; helix84: not yet.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; the toppic come up to day (and I should have done other things. ;-))</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; The first answer has an update that tells it is possible to add the jasper servlet init to the web.xml of any webapp.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; sorry, I just mixed it up. It can be done by webapp and not by servlet (my fault).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; so, why not just tweak the JSPUI 'web.xml' to init properly?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; so we could add this to the jspuis web.xml, but I don't know yet what this means for any other servlet container then tomcat.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: those would be tomcat-specific parameters in web.xml</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: cause it seems to be tomcat specific code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; what they said</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; TBH, I don't think we have many users who do NOT use Tomcat.  I think you're worrying about 1% of the user base...unless you all know of a large amount of users on a different servlet container</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I would suggest to leave the situation as it is and use java 1.6 in the jsps. With DSpace 6 I would like to require tomcat 8 which uses java 1.7 by default to compile jsps.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, if it "works" for 99% of the users, then we just add a comment that says: "If you are NOT using Tomcat, you may wish to comment out these Tomcat specific params"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'd be more comfortable depending on documentation for this, it's not our job to fix a Tomcat bug</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: what about jetty for automated testing? (although that probably won't aply to JSP)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; we don't use jetty, helix84</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger has seen Jetty testing setups for DSpace, there's a writeup on one somewhere...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; I would go with hpottinger: we already have tomcat specific documentation. We can add it there. Or leave the situation as it is and require tomcat 8 for DSpace 6 which would solve it as well.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[15:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Honestly, DSpace is extremely Tomcat specific already. While it should be *possible* to run it on other servlet containers, as far as I'm aware, we NEVER test on anything other than Tomcat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; tdonohue: I would prefer to loosen the tomcat dependency then to increase it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; tdonohue: If you're arguing for just documenting it, then we're not making DSpace any more Tomcat specific (not modifying jspui's web.xml)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, we have two options.  Add these init-params to the JSPUI, web.xml, or just document it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; pbecker++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I'm +1 document it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I notice we're mostly XMLUI guys here making a JSPUI decision</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we don't have to decide now</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; the question is: do we want to document it and use the same java version for jsps and the rest or do we want to use java 1.6 for dspace-5-jsps and upgrade to tomcat 8 with dspace 6?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; pbecker: but that's a completely different discussion. I'd rather we not mix up two conversations. I'd be OK with loosening our requirements, but that's a *much bigger* discussion than this 2249 ticket (and one that'd need to happen *after* 5.0 at this point)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;roeland_atmire&gt; I would say document now and see if we can find a better solution by rc2</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; roeland_atmire++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; documenting it for now is fine by me</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; perhaps I should mention that we currently have only one jsp using java 1.7 which was fixed to day.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; okay. So I document it in the ticket and the DSpace 5 docs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; sounds good</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:02]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; and I leave the ticket open for now.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we also should put keep track of these outstanding tasks to the release status page</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OK, so, to be clear, it's OK to keep letting Tomcat 7 using 1.6 for JSPs, just it might catch someone else out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[16:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;pbecker&gt; and thanks again to roeland: his comment was really helpful on investigating this!</span><br />
