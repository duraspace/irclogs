<span class="irc-date">[19:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hi mark</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I'm looking at last week's agenda</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; we talked about metadata for all</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; among other ongoing topics is Migrate Search and Browse to DSpace Discovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; do you have any comments/opinions on that? :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I've not tried Discovery yet.  So it's hard to have comments on that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; erm, I'm here, too</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hi hardy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger just noticed that tdonohue1 is home with a sick kid today and is in lurker mode.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; :O you haven't tried Discovery? like ever?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger raises a hand, guilty, too.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Ever.  We're about to upgrade here and I plan to propose moving to it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* helix84 is shocked with surprise</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but surely you played with it on your dev machine</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; 'fraid not.  I've been meaning to....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; similar plans, and yes, played a tiny bit.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; wow, ok :) in that case is there anything you'd like to ask?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; re-reading the proposal</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Migrate+Search+and+Browse+to+DSpace+Discovery">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSPACE/Migrate+Search+and+Browse+to+DSpace+Discovery</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the code is here: DS-1272</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1272">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1272</a> ] - [#DS-1272] Enable Discovery By Default - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:12]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; well... I've not tried setting up Discovery "the old way" and lazy ol' me thinks that merging pull 91 into my fork of DSpace may be just the ticket for trying it out...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I haven't tried #91, either. It was quickly reverted because it was breaking tests (IIRC)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:13]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; The proposal sounds reasonable.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; But the safe way to enable Discovery is described here: <a href="https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC3x/Discovery#Discovery-EnablingDiscovery">https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/DSDOC3x/Discovery#Discovery-EnablingDiscovery</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Sounds like it was one of those contributions that came in too late to work up for release?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:14]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, a while after Discovey/JSPUI came in</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I think we even voted on it, just don't remember where</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; well then, perhaps I'll aspire to be useful while testing Discovery :-) and also test pull 91</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; apropos, we should record all our votes somewhere</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; This channel is logged.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:15]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger pats Duralogbot on the head.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: I know. But we need some indexing, too, otherwise we'll never know what we already voted on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Point.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; (at least my memory is full of holes)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Typically the discussion is pasted into the relevant JIRA issue, so at least it would not be too hard to discover whether a specific issue was voted.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Memory, do I have memory, I don't recall.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; my memory is trying to tell me that we *did* vote on 1272, and I think I did push the green button on pull 91, but it had to be reverted?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; that surely helps. we should be diligent about that</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; yes, having memory helps, too :)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: it was reverted because it made tests fail (according to my memory)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and thus the point that we need to record votes was demonstrated</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ok, I guess that's it about Discovery</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:19]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; ready for next topic?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:20]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; so, my takeaway is, go ahead and try pull 91, but expect some stuff to break</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; as a public service, just thought I'd echo something that mhwood and I were discussing earlier <a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2013/01/31/java-6-end-life-impact-apache-tomcat-users">http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2013/01/31/java-6-end-life-impact-apache-tomcat-users</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ Java 6 End of Life Impact for Apache Tomcat Users | TomcatExpert ] - <a href="http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2013/01/31/java-6-end-life-impact-apache-tomcat-users">http://www.tomcatexpert.com/blog/2013/01/31/java-6-end-life-impact-apache-tomcat-users</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:21]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: only the tests are known to break, AFAIK. other than that, Discovery/XMLUI has been around since 1.7, so it's stable. of course, PR 91 might break something, sure.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:22]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I thought Java 6 will live on in IcedTea</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:23]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; but this seems to be specifically about Tomcat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; the general notion is that we're all looking at upgrades this year</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:24]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; At some point OpenJDK will stop fixing old releases.  OpenJDK/IcedTea 7 has been out for some time and they are talking about 8.  Oracle Java is OpenJDK (the reference implementation) blessed by Oracle and with a few proprietary goodies sprinkled on.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; IIRC problems that have been reported on DSpace with Java 7 have mostly been to do with Tomcat.  True?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:25]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the only problem I remember was with Solr, if memory serves</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; DS-1081</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:26]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1081">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1081</a> ] - [#DS-1081] Ensure that DSpace can run on java 7 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; All this rumination was in response to recollection of comments by Andrea Schweer, about difficulty with DSpace and Java 7 (which I only have secondhand).</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; one other problem was related to XmlWorkflow, which is an optional feature. that was fixed.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:27]</span> <span class="irc-green">* bigbrovar_ (~quassel@41.206.12.37.vgccl.net) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, maybe for 4.0 we need to schedule a task to qualify Java 7 for DSpace support.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* bigbrovar (~quassel@83.229.6.19) Quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; right, Andrea mentioned she was having trouble getting an existing repo (presumably 1.8.x) running on Java 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Oops, well of course 1081 would be that task.  We just need it on the schedule for 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:28]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well demo has been running on OpenJDK 7 since before we put 3.0 on it</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I can't find anything about Andrea's problem. Where was it?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I ran some stuff on Java 7 for a while, but my development tools disliked it.  Time to try again.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:29]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I need to remember to copy over some of demo's setup, I'd like to be able to easily swap out parts of the stack</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84, Andrea and I were just chatting yesterday, she had a specific question which lead down the road towards this more general question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:30]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the point is, the problem should be in Jira</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-green">* bigbrovar (~quassel@83.229.6.19) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:31]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; helix84++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; She may be working toward the point of filing an issue.  One hesitates to fill up JIRA with things that turn out to be "oops, my fault, nevermind."</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:32]</span> <span class="irc-navy">* bigbrovar_ (~quassel@41.206.12.37.vgccl.net) Quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; I *should* hesitate, but often do not, alas. :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:34]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; anyway, my opinion is that we're ready for 4.0 by having OpenJDK 7 on demo. and any issues can be filed and tracked as they come up.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-green">* aschweer (~schweer@schweer.its.waikato.ac.nz) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; my ears were burning</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:35]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Yes, probably time for us all to be using 7 in our dev. environment and work away at problems found.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; I never got around to diagnosing my Java 7 issues (yup this was 1.8.2) -- we went back to Java 6 after Java 7 crashed tomcat</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:36]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; OH HAI aschweer :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:37]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; so I never filed a Jira issue because I don't know what the problem was or even how to reproduce it (all was good on the test server, but the test server doesn't have the same number of CPUs / amount of RAM as the production one)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:38]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; don't worry, we all hit such irreproducible bugs and equally hate them</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; I think that others saw difficulties between Java 7 and Tomcat, and they were addressed.  Latest versions may work better together.  I imagine that such things would be high priority for the Tomcat team.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:39]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So, I should try it myself and find out.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:40]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; maybe I should be brave and switch over my test instances to Java 7. and possibly push for adjusting CPUs/RAM to match production so that they'll (hopefully) use the same garbage collection strategies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sounds like a good strategy</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:41]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Humph, Gentoo Linux has three icedtea-bin:7 rev.s in Portage, *all* keyworded on all arches.  I should ask (again) what they need to stabilize one.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* hpottinger notes that DS-1081 is "closed"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1081">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-1081</a> ] - [#DS-1081] Ensure that DSpace can run on java 7 - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:42]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: like I said, all known issues were fixed and any new ones should be opened as they pop up</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; hpottinger: that was the decision at that time</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:43]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; sounds good, just a few lines back, someone was suggesting bumping 1081 to 4.0</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; So should a message go out on -devel asking people to try Java 7, it should be better now?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; mhwood++</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;hpottinger&gt; and if it's not "better" we need to know, like, now :-)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:46]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;aschweer&gt; plus ask those who already run / have already tried Java 7 for their experiences I guess</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:47]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; mhwood: well it is listed as supported in 3.0 docs and has been through testathon on OpenJDK 7</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; anything else you'd like to talk about?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Do we need a periodic Pull Request review?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; well PRs _should_ be referenced from Jira</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; and it has to be done manually. the generic git plugin for Jira doesn't recognize pull requests because it's a GitHub-specific feature</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; so theoretically no, practically it won't hurt</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:54]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; GitHub, OTOH, can trigger things on other servers.  I have a trigger that pokes a local Jenkins instance.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; in that case you can earn a little cash</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:55]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; I think not only us could use a GitHub plugin for Jira which would track PRs for issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; Interesting.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; But a PR is just a one-time event.  We get mail about new issues, but we found that we need to follow up after a while to see if there is progress and if not, why not.  I wonder if we need the same thing for PRs.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; If you want to win, there are other things that such plugin could do that go beyond what we need in DSpace. Perhaps creating issues in Jira for issues created on GitHub, working with milestones etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the problem is that PRs can stay open if not dealt with right away, and subsequently forgotten. so they need to be tracked.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mhwood&gt; All good stuff, but I don't have any Atlassian stuff locally and so no experience with extending it.  I can see what can be done about that.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; the best course of action would be to assign them as "attributes" to Jira issues</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; because in comments they're kind of lost</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;helix84&gt; speaking of Jira, does anyone know what the difference between "epic" and "label" is?</span><br />
