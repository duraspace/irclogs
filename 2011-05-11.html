<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; let's try that again. We're starting with DS-797</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-797">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-797</a> ] - [#DS-797] ant help says install_code target exists, but it doesn't - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:02]</span> <span class="irc-green">* sandsfish (~sandsfish@dhcp-18-111-52-74.dyn.mit.edu) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Yep, ds-797 is a bug. Even on Trunk code, 'ant help' says there's such a thing as 'ant install_code' (when in fact, that target doesn't exist)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ds-797">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/ds-797</a> ] - [#DS-797] ant help says install_code target exists, but it doesn't - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; any thoughts on this? should we create 'ant install_code'? or fix the output of 'ant help'?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; no, what would install code mean?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; update installs code changes</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; deploy a code build without overwriting config?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I think this is old cruft leftover from the old build</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-green">* mhwood (~mhwood@99.162.50.38) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; I think, based on Ivan's request in Ds-797, he thought it should install Code without touching the DB again (not sure how much use that would get though)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-green">* KevinVdV (~KevinVdV@d54C15567.access.telenet.be) has joined #duraspace</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, is this a 'won't fix'? or Ask Ivan for more info?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue: any recommendation given your digging in this dirt with the installer?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I assume we want something like what sandsfish just pointed out</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;JRhoads&gt; Has anyone requested an install without touching the DB?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, what sandsfish said would likely be useful.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; albeit we generally overwrite everything with 'ant update -Doverwrite=true</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; vs not overwrite config directly with 'ant update -Doverwrite=false'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt;  &lt;echo message="install_code    --&gt; Install compiled code into ${dspace.dir}" /&gt;</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; ant doesn't compile anymore...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; just copies</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; thus "update"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, it says it's *installing* (pre-compiled) code to $(dspace.dir)"</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; yup, installs/copies.  that's how it's documented in build.xml atm</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok, I suggest we do the following: DS-797, ask Ivan for more info on usage, see if there's a better replacement for install_code, possibly suggest 'ant update'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;kompewter&gt; [ <a href="https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-797">https://jira.duraspace.org/browse/DS-797</a> ] - [#DS-797] ant help says install_code target exists, but it doesn't - DuraSpace JIRA</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; kinda misleading... what does it copy?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; that was a retorical question</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; i personally haven't seen a use case where i needed this, so either more info or no fix is my vote.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; not in configuration files...  and to expand on this we need something like Metadata Bundles which would have ResourcePolicies attached</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- yea, it looks like that is robint's recommendation down in the comments</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; So that we can have system, descriptive, administrative, bitstream metadata sections in a DSpace Item</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; and align completely with METS metadata sections and possibly align with Fedora Datastreams that are metadata centric</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; perhaps this is an architecture question that needs some further hashing out/design.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; i can see the work taking on a few different shapes/sizes.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Maybe we should follow up with robint on this one?..I'd like to here how this overlaps with other linked issues, etc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue:  yes I'm expanding on Robins suggestion....</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; ok. Ds-800 Summary: Followup with Robint.  May need more discussion around necessary architecture changes and other related JIRA tickets.  Needs volunteer</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:48]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Github is what we're leaning towards for WebMVC. Should be best for getting the student connected to the code.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- I guess that was what I was asking.  Just cause we haven't "seen" a dialog in public doesn't mean that Mentors haven't started some sort of dialog with students.

<span class="irc-date">[20:49]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I'm quite active on a number of the projects and I will say the dialog is lacking</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: yea, that might be good to shift to a more "public" area soon-ish, if possible. Either dspace-devel or duraspace-gsoc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:50]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; the challenge is that we will not get cross pollination if the dialog is not public</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; its for the students benefit... especially in the the WebMVC/REST area</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; right, hence the request to try and bring more discussions to 'duraspace-gsoc' or 'dspace-devel', to see if we can get more feedback to each of these projects, and see if there are cross-pollination opportunities or not</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:51]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I was somewhat wondering to myself how strong is the REST API's mechanism for determining which controller responds to which URL.

<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;sandsfish&gt; duraspace-gsoc seems to make sense.  there's already a decent amount of traffic on dspace-devel that it might get lost in.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs1&gt; I should clarify PeterDietz's point - Robert dropped us an email asking if he there was anything he could be doing now, and we've replied with a courtesy email containing a couple of suggestions, whilst we discuss the GitHub issue.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:52]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; +1 sandsfish. I'd probably recommend 'duraspace-gsoc' over dspace-devel (at least right now).</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:53]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: yes... Vibhaj, Bojan and I are dialoging about the possiblity of adopting Spring REST instead of EntityBroker</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[20:56]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- yea, but at the same time. dspace-devel is very "bogged down" these days. I'd hate to throw a student into that list immediately.  Just like in past years we've always had a separate GsoC public list</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:57]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; yea and I realized it didn't really work then as well</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; I worry that the benefits of the community dialog are lost when trying to protect the student.... it may be premature to be trying to protect the student, isn't the dialog what DSpace developer community is about?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; Ok. The other thing to point out is that obviously using 'duraspace-gsoc' is a way to also get Fedora or DuraCloud feedback.  Admittedly, that may not be as important this year (as no projects have huge overlaps with other technologies), but it's another reason why we created 'duraspace-gsoc'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:58]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; to be honest though, I'm fine with leaving it up to the Mentors to decide.  I think the more important thing is to move discussions to being more public, whether that is dspace-devel or duraspace-gsoc</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; grahamtriggs1: sorry for dropping the ball on responding about continuing sync of svn/github. I'd prefer to not sync github down to svn. Especially since you can svn co <a href="https://svn.github.com/DSpace/webmvc.git">https://svn.github.com/DSpace/webmvc.git</a></span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[20:59]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; (sorry for directing towards tangent).. You can svn co a github project: <a href="https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support">https://github.com/blog/626-announcing-svn-support</a></span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; maybe a happy medium is to post an email in the dspace-developer list to please join into the duraspace-gsoc list...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;JRhoads&gt; I'm gonna have to run (Lab closing).  Good stuff today and great discussions on the dspace-devel list.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:00]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; So, I'd recommend that all Mentors try and bring any discussions with Students to a move 'public' area.  It's up to you if you feel the initial discussion should be put on dspace-devel or 'duraspace-gsoc'</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory : that's actually already been done, several times during this GSoC process ;)  But, I was planning to post another reminder to dspace-devel to join duraspace-gsoc for more info</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:01]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I guess we're always free to cross-post to dspace-devel, when something might be relevant to the wider group.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:03]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs1&gt; PeterDietz: I'm not bothered about syncing Git -&gt; SVN. I'm more concerned about what might happen if we are developing on a Git project that is being synced FROM svn (as it currently is). And what if we decide to make occassional drops to svn whilst that is still the 'official' repository, etc.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; That's everything we really have time for today.  So, unless there are other questions/comments, I'd say we can close up the official meeting for today (but feel free to continue any discussions)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:04]</span> <span class="irc-brick">* scottatm thinks we should just pick a day and switch to git. syncing the repositories seems like a recipe for disaster.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; scottatm -- I think the problem is that we're still trying to get a majority in favor of that switch ;)   So, I think PeterDietz's 'syncing' idea is just to try and give us tools to get more comfortable with github</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; scottatm: been in that disaster already</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs1&gt; scottatm: I tend to agree. Although I think a few more of us would like experience using Git before we can make that decision. Hence why GSoC projects are a good 'canary'</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:05]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;scottatm&gt; Oh, yes. I'm not suggesting we should do that just now. I meant when we eventually decide to switch we should just flag day it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: grahamtriggs can we get the students a decent starting point in git or at least a guideline of some sort</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:06]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;scottatm&gt; Like we could say, 1.8.x will be the last release on SVN, 1.9 and above will be GIT?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; for instance, put the rest project there as well and discuss how to fork for prototyping...</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, I agree. I don't see "syncing" as a long term solution.  At some point we either switch entirely or we decide entirely against it -- my point is that we need a majority and right now I'm not sure we have that (although it does seem we're getting closer to that)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:07]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'd prefer that once development begins for a project in github, that we cease svn commits. Perhaps even stopping the cron sync. Then then deleting the svn repo al-together</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; PeterDietz: the challenge is that the svn repo is there for legacy purposes... theres even one still at SF</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;scottatm&gt; And the one at SF still has a stale code base there.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:08]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; it better be</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; I'd prefer to not keep that around.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tjohnson&gt; mdiggory: what's wrong with importing the whole history via git-svn and nuking the old repo?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;grahamtriggs1&gt; PeterDietz: but I'm not clear on how these have been setup. For example: WebMVC is a separate Git repository from DSpace trunk? And there are separate crons for syncing each?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; yea, we'd probably never *remove* the svn repo, to be honest (just like Fedora didn't remove theirs when they went to github).  But we would make it entirely "read only".</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:09]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; tdonohue:  right</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; tjohnson: That's half of what's been done with the main dspace trunk. And for the module/webmvc. (No nukes yet, we're all nervous after what happened to Japan)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; (but that is something we could still discuss -- just pointing out that Fedora actually decided against removing their old SVN, at least for now)</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:10]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;scottatm&gt; The negative side of leaving the old repos around is that there's still lots of links around the web to them. Someone new to the project will stumble on one of those and think that no one has updated DSpace is a long time.</span><br />

<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;PeterDietz&gt; Things have died down. Last word on using github for webmvc?</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; TBH... if we switch to Git.... OSL may want to take down the scm server</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:16]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;mdiggory&gt; there may not be much choice there</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:17]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; PeterDietz: I'd say feel free to use it, if all on the webmvc project are OK with it.</span><br />
<span class="irc-date">[21:18]</span> <span class="irc-black">&lt;tdonohue&gt; mdiggory -- yea, I think this is all something we'll figure out once we come to a decision around github.  We can also always just "archive" an old, read-only copy of the DSpace SVN at <a href="https://svn.duraspace.org/">https://svn.duraspace.org/</a> if we wanted to (or elsewhere, just in case we ever really needed it)</span><br />
